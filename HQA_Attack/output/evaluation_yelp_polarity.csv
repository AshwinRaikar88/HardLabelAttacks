0,"We flew to Vegas from Portland, OR  to stay at the Cosmo and hear Gareth Emery as a celebration for our 8th wedding anniversary. We bought tickets for Gareth Emery online and stayed at the Cosmo (4 nights). We paid 50.00 for a guys ticket and 20.00 for mine. We are big fans of the DJ and planned our trip around this event. When we got to the club the guy said oh since you are a hotel guest, you get in free. So basically we wasted $70? Nobody told us that before. Anyways we get in and by 12 we werent allowed by security to get on the dance floor and aggressively told that we couldnt stand around but had to keep walking towards outside or another room. I told them that we are there for this dj and they didnt care. They eventually let us on the dance floor and it was dangerous...people pushing...way over the limit. We didnt stay for the entire set and we were so frustrated. There were several crowd control guys with flashlights constantly telling us to keep moving. How about telling the people to move who don't even know who the dj is? Its just not fair that fans of the dj cant even enjoy a show. We are very upset by this experience. We have been to Marquee in the past and heard ATB and others and had similar experiences but by far this was the worst.","We flew to Vegas from Portland, OR to stay at the Cosmo and hear Gareth Emery as a celebration for our 8th wedding anniversary.

1,"We located this brand new spot in LV a couple weeks ago whilst attempting to find a spot to have lunch. My brother and I were traipsing all over the Palazzo and I had decided to take him to lunch at First Food & Bar upstairs. Unfortunately some changes must have been made at First because they routed us downstairs to Rattlecan, stating that the menu was by the same chef and so would be similar. \n\nWell - yes and no. For starters, Rattlecan is kind of synonymous with everything that I hate about the cheesiest parts of Las Vegas. Garrish, loud decor spills out from around every corner and pops out of every wall. The Urban Daddy piece written about RC describes it as \""""This feels like a place where Axl Rose would have started a fight on the Appetite for Destruction tour,\"""" but my response to that is \""""Not hardly.\"""" \n\nFor one the menu is priced way to high for anybody on the Appetite for Destruction tour. For too, I doubt Axl Rose would have ventured past the entrance to the restaurant after casting his eye inward. \n\nAnyway...the food, which is REALLY what this is about. We had the Pastrami Sandwich and Mini Wagyu Burgers. \n\nThe Pastrami sandwich was very serviceable, along with the mini Wagyu sliders, although, I seriously doubt that the sliders were made with real Wagyu. Tasted like burger meat to me. \n\nUnfortunately I'm going to have to pass on this experience and I can't really recommend it to others. The food was decent, and the service was good too, but at the end of the day there are just tons and tons of better choices to be made in Las Vegas. At the price point these guys are charging you are better off venturing elsewhere, such as First Food & Bar or even a lower end steakhouse for their bar menu.","We located this brand new spot in LV a couple weeks ago whilst attempting to find a spot to have lunch.

19,"Don't even think about being late to your appointment!\nLet me preface this by saying I am not a big fan of suddenly slimmer who owns Rio Wax. I used to go there quite often but after being treated so rudely several times, I decided to spend my money elsewhere. \nI purchased a groupon for Rio Wax & was excited that Danielli opened her own place because she was the only good thing about suddenly slimmer. Of course everyone else feels the same way so it is nearly impossible to get an appt with her. The first few times I went to Rio Wax, I had as much of a pleasant experience as one can have when she gets a wax service. The people were nice, I was satisfied with the results, it was kind-of pricey but overall worth it. \nThis last visit reminded me of being at Suddenly Slimmer all over again. I scheduled an appointment 3 weeks in advance as I prepared for a vacation to Cabo. I called on my way to let them know I would be 5 - 10 minutes late since there was an accident by my house & I would have to go a different route. The girl on the phone told me they may not be able to hold my appointment because they had back to back appointments. This surprised me considering I was doing the courteous thing by calling ahead & it was not something I had any control over. She put me on hold & came back & said that would be fine. She failed to mention there was construction on Indian School Road & you could not make a left turn onto 32nd street. Anyway, by the time I made it through that mess, I was a whopping 7 minutes late. I walked in & apologized. The receptionist then proceeds to tell me the esthetician may or may not be able to complete my entire wax. I nearly dropped my jaw. I don't know about you but I have sat in that waiting room plenty of times because they were behind & never once complained & this was the answer I get for being 7 minutes late! If this was such a problem, then offer an alternative time. It wouldn't have thrilled me to have to go back later but it was better than offering me a partial wax!\nI voiced all of this & reminded them that there are plenty of other salons in this city. \nI'm in the customer service industry & I understand things don't always work out the way we would like & it is not always easy to accommodate everyone but at least find an alternative solution.

He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).\nMy partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).

33,"We were so fortunate to get two seats at the bar of Emeril's NO Fish House at the MGM Grand in Vegas!!!

I've written a separate review for him.","I saw Dr. Lucious Blanchard on 3-31-14 at the Tenaya location. I arrived at 12:30pm. My appointment was for 1:15pm. I left this office at 2:45pm. I was given a prescription cream to rub all over my body where there were rashes. He said it was severe eczema with a possible infection from scratching. \n\nI asked for antibiotics, he said no. Ask your primary care doctor. I told him I'm asking you for it because my primary care doctor won't give it to me because it has to do with these rashes, and the primary doctor's excuse is since it has to do with these rashes, and it's a dermatology specialist's concern, let him give you the antibiotics.\n\nSo, I have an infection from scratching all my \""""eczema\"""" rashes that look like measles or chicken pox, and neither my primary care doctor nor my dermatology specialist will give me a prescription for some antibiotics, just cream to rub all over my body. \n\nI filled the prescription for the cream, rubbed it on my rashes, and felt like a little worm tickling and crawling under my skin. I called my primary care doctor about it. He said call the specialist back. I called the specialist. They didn't return my call that week.\n\nI called my \""""telephone advice nurse\"""" to get approval to go to Urgent Care because it was the weekend, neither my primary care doctor nor the specialist addressed my concern about feeling like something is crawling underneath my skin and tickling. \n\nI get to Urgent Care, the nurse is being overly strong and stern with me with an accompanying Samoan, Mexican, or Philipino accent. His voice gets deep when asking me for a 2nd time straight \""""When did it start.\"""" I see the Asian female doctor in Urgent Care. She asks me \""""Are you an alcoholic or hardcore drug abuser?\"""" I said no.\n\nShe gives me a prescription for hydroxyzene to stop the itching from a severe allergic reaction brought on from rubbing cream on my \""""severe eczema\"""" rashes. The cream contained cortisone and hydrocortisone, which I'm allergic to, and what I filled out in the electronic tablet, told Dr. Blanchard's nurse, and mentioned to Dr. Blanchard himself. \n\nHow could this mistake have happened? It's May 14th. I have had this problem since February. I waited for my referall to be processed. I went to the specialist. Now I've been to a dermatology specialist 3 times. 3-31-14, 4-12-14, and 5-13-14. \n\nI stopped seeing Dr. Blanchard after his and his nurse's mistake. I reported them to HPN Member Services.

40,"My family ate here for the first time recently. The server was friendly, the place was clean and family friendly. Separate bar area with TVs for the sports fans. They had a lot of people at the bar even though it was a Wed night and the place was fairly busy. Husband got a cheeseburger and fries, that was really GOOD! They cooked it medium but just barely as they knew he liked it medium rare. The kids meal was a great deal, macaroni and cheese with a side of baked potato. My kids were able to split it so it was perfect! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken flat bread. It was sort of like a pizza with balsamic marinated chicken, olives, onions, and feta. My only criticism is it really needed some mozzarella and just a hint of feta. Instead it had no mozzarella at all and the only cheese on it was feta. TONS of feta. I scraped most of it off and left it on my plate. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious, but with no melt-able cheese to hold everything together it was a little hard to eat and everything kept falling off. And that much feta is just too strong.

79,"I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could but I'll round up.\n\nI really liked the view and the ambiance of the restaurant.  The food was okay, but NOT spectacular.\n\nWe asked the sommelier to suggest a wine to accompany our dinner, somewhere between $100 - $150.  The bottle he picked was a decent bottle of French Bordeaux, but $160, he had to go over by ten dollars.\n\nThe service was just okay, they messed up my order & they were not clear about ordering dessert.  The server said that the souffle had to be ordered at the beginning of dinner, but he did not mention that all the other desserts on the menu also had to be ordered in advance.  Thankfully 1 soufflee for 4 people was more than enough.\n\nI think the appetizers were the best part of the meal!\n\nFor more info on our dinner, I will defer to Chiyo W.'s review.  She's soooo on top of those details :-p.\n\nOnce is enough for me, I probably won't go again.  Too expense for what was served.",---,---,0,False

83,"I came here with my boyfriend's family (who are Mauritian) on a Sunday night for his mom's birthday dinner. The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.\n\nAlthough the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us. He finally came back to bring them to us, and took our order. \n\nWe ordered the seafood soup, crab balls (YUM), beef & Chinese broccoli, crispy chicken, chow fun with black bean sauce, chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice, Cantonese-style lobster and just regular steamed rice. We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen. \n\nOur food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought;\n- The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance).\n- The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though.\n- The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh.\n- The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it.\n- I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being. \n- The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.\n\nI don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.\n\nI was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies. \n\nSo all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung.",---,---,0,False

144,"Ok first off I have been a long time, and I mean long time, customer of Verizon Wireless... I'm talkin 15 years! So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package. I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all. Specifically, my unlimited data plan. In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also. They told him the same thing, that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to. So fast forward to today, June 20th, I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road. The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to. I'm like, what?!?!?! I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract. He told me, and these were his words, \""""Well, the lied to you\""""! WTH!!!!! I was majorly p'd off!!!!! I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out. So, I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence, the Verizon rep. Blah blah blah.... can I please speak to your manager... 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes), Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone. She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new \""""plans\"""" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider. I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers. I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service.

150,"Okay, here it goes...this may get long winded but I swear it is a truthful and honest review, so please read closely\n\nI lived at Lakeside (formerly known as Lakeside Village) for over 3 years, through 2013 and I saw the old management company Con AM get bought out by another management company called Madrona Ridge. Con Am wasn't the best, but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over.\n\nWhen I first moved here they were literally giving apartments away, they were offering less than $500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town, with a lake view, so it was a good deal. For the first 2 years there it was pretty solid, the managers knew my name, they cared about my problems and fixed anything I needed immediately, I'm talking same day service. They were nice people. Con AM and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.\n\nAround the time Madrona Ridge took over things just got ratty. Loud and creepy people started moving in, bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them. Supposedly they have a no crime policy and won't rent to criminals, yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their DUI's and jail time. A lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night. I saw a drunk guy smash someone's windshield in a fit of rage and sped off, and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all. The landscapers didn't care to pick it up, the maintenance guys didn't care, so there it sat.\nMadrona Ridge promised all previous residents even better service than Con Am gave. I was wrapping up a lease when Madrona Ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal, so I stayed. But right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint. They hired the current girls who manage Lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show. \n\nThe current staff working here are probably the slowest, rudest, most impersonal women around. These girls Traci and Lucinda are NOT right for this job. They are NOT friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern, they are NOT accommodating or welcoming, no smiles, just a bland \""""I don't care\"""" attitude. If you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt. They also won't bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service, they'll just call you \""""HEY\"""" or \""""You.\"""" Also, if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they don't listen to their voicemails or return phone calls. \n\n I've had problems with bugs, repairs, questions, and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again. In the early days when I needed something fixed con-am would have it fixed in a day or two, these girls will make sure it takes over a week if you're lucky. So either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait, because as these managers know you aren't that important. Seriously...how hard is it to FAKE customer service? At least try to remember someone's name and care a little bit, a fake smile, anything helps, especially in a SALES position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar. FYI.\n\nI left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease, they offered me a new lease agreement that was ABSURD and overpriced. The one bedrooms here are 600 square feet, just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980's, and they are now asking $725.00+ per month...that doesn't include taxes, pet rent (if you have em) and utilities. So basically they are charging around $800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex, when you can go find a nice, NEW, cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month. Uhhh yeah, no thanks lakeside! I did just that and found a better, nicer, newer place for only pennies more than here. \n\n Do not believe the website, it is totally false advertised. What you see online is NOT what you will get in person. What you'll really see are outdated appliances from the 80's, peeling paint, popcorn ceilings, cheap carpeting, tiny closets, and no storage space. \n\nLakeside used to be a lot better, I used to love it at first and I'm grateful for the good times I had while it lasted. The management used to be nicer, the grounds used to be cleaner, and the prices used to be reasonable. This place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think it's a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down, ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag, and the service you get isn't worth a dollar. \n\nThe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time, there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby, but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value.","Okay, here it goes...this may get long winded but I swear it is a truthful and honest review, so please read closely\n\nI lived at Lakeside (formerly known as Lakeside Village) for over 3 years, through 2013 and I saw the old management company Con AM get bought out by another management company called Madrona Ridge.

For the first 2 years there it was pretty solid, the managers knew my name, they cared about my problems and fixed anything I needed immediately, I'm talking same day service. They were nice people. Con AM and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.\n\nAround the time Madrona Ridge took over things just got ratty. Loud and creepy people started moving in, bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them. Supposedly they have a no crime policy and won't rent to criminals, yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their DUI's and jail time. A lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night. I saw a drunk guy smash someone's windshield in a fit of rage and sped off, and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all. The landscapers didn't care to pick it up, the maintenance guys didn't care, so there it sat.\nMadrona Ridge promised all previous residents even better service than Con Am gave. I was wrapping up a lease when Madrona Ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal, so I stayed. But right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint. They hired the current girls who manage Lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show. \n\nThe current staff working here are probably the slowest, rudest, most impersonal women around. These girls Traci and Lucinda are NOT right for this job. They are NOT friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern, they are NOT accommodating or welcoming, no smiles, just a bland \""""I don't care\"""" attitude. If you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt. They also won't bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service, they'll just call you \""""HEY\"""" or \""""You.\"""" Also, if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they don't listen to their voicemails or return phone calls. \n\n I've had problems with bugs, repairs, questions, and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again. In the early days when I needed something fixed con-am would have it fixed in a day or two, these girls will make sure it takes over a week if you're lucky. So either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait, because as these managers know you aren't that important. Seriously...how hard is it to FAKE customer service? At least try to remember someone's name and care a little bit, a fake smile, anything helps, especially in a SALES position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar. FYI.\n\nI left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease, they offered me a new lease agreement that was ABSURD and overpriced. The one bedrooms here are 600 square feet, just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980's, and they are now asking $725.00+ per month...that doesn't include taxes, pet rent (if you have em) and utilities. So basically they are charging around $800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex, when you can go find a nice, NEW, cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month. Uhhh yeah, no thanks lakeside! I did just that and found a better, nicer, newer place for only pennies more than here. \n\n Do not believe the website, it is totally false advertised. What you see online is NOT what you will get in person. What you'll really see are outdated appliances from the 80's, peeling paint, popcorn ceilings, cheap carpeting, tiny closets, and no storage space. \n\nLakeside used to be a lot better, I used to love it at first and I'm grateful for the good times I had while it lasted. The management used to be nicer, the grounds used to be cleaner, and the prices used to be reasonable. This place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think it's a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down, ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag, and the service you get isn't worth a dollar. \n\nThe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time, there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby, but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value.",5000,False

196,"All over, people are raving about Five Guys Burgers & Fries. My friend up in Washington says she loves them. On their website they show off everyone singing their praises.\n\nI must not get it.\n\nI've been wanting to try them for quite some time, and learned they now have a spot open on the Strip (not the touristy part everyone knows, but a little further past Mandalay Bay at the Premium Outlets South). As that is on the way to my gym, I decided to roll out early, stop at Five Guys, and work it off at Fight Capital.\n\nWalking in, you feel good about the place. It's kinda diner-y, simple... tables, chairs, and a team of employees hurriedly working on food in the kitchen. Kinda In-N-Out-esque. REALLY In-N-Out-esque. Like, you wonder if you walked into an In-N-Out instead of Five Guys. There was only one person ahead of me in line, and the cashier, Michelle, was quick and pleasant. I ordered a Bacon Burger, which if you leave it that way, is just that: bread, patty (actually two) and bacon. Anything else on it you have to make sure to specify, so I added my standard toppings -- lettuce, tomato, and BBQ sauce. An onion ring might have been a nice touch, but hey, I don't run the place. Didn't see mustard on the list... hmmmm... well, it's probably by the ketchup, because I didn't see that on the list either. I also ordered some Cajun fries and a drink.\n\nSo, let's start with some of the good things here. First off, the employees are very efficient. One person barked orders at the other, everyone had their station, very assembly-line style, and I got my food quickly, which was great because I was famished. Secondly, the Coke machine is, without a doubt, very cool. It's one of those new Coke-brand stations with a touch screen. You touch the soda you want, then you choose regular or with flavored syrup, and POOF -- it's Cokeapalooza! I went with a cherry Coke Zero. Wise choice. On my second visit I noticed there was Diet Barq's (root beer with BITE!), but no cherry option, and I was really diggin' on the cherry Coke Zero, so I went back to that.\n\nThe Cajun fries were some of the best I've had in a really long time. Zing-y, spicy, good with or without ketchup. Definitely was loving the fries.\n\nDefinitely was NOT loving the burger. Sure, it was a nice surprise that the burgers came standard with two patties, but they were kinda dry and lifeless. Apparently standard setting for their burgers is well-done. Any cook or chef will tell you that overcooking ground beef will cook out the juice and flavor of the meat, and that's what happened here. Bacon was overcooked as well. And by \""""overcooked\"""" I mean \""""burnt.\"""" Fortunately I had sauces to back me up, BBQ sauce and.....\n\nOh yeah. That's another thing. There's no mustard in the entire restaurant. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MUSTARD IN THE ENTIRE HAMBURGER JOINT. No pump, no packets, nothing. I looked on the Coke machine to see if they had it stashed on their touch-screen. I thought about asking, but that would require the only non-assembly-line employee to leave her cash register. Plus, I thought, I shouldn't have to ask for mustard in a friggin' burger joint.\n\nFinal blow: Price. I ordered burgers, fries, and a drink, thinking, meh. $8. Should be okay with that. Oh no no, my friend. Everything is a la carte and you will order and take it up the wallet, my friend. By the time I had finished my order I was $11 in and there was no turning back. it felt as if the place was called \""""Five Guys\"""" because you'd be paying the paychecks for five guys. Now, I would expect to pay $11, maybe more, at Holsteins or Burger Bar, where I would also not be looking for a \""""quick bite\"""" and know I would get more (much more) bang for my buck (all eleven of them). This was not $11 quality. Nowhere close. Ironic, as I stared at the sign that said the Washingtonian or some other print media said in 2007 it was the \""""best bargain\"""" around. Apparently in Washington you make a bazillion dollars an hour there. (Hmm... maybe The Gazillionaire is from Washington...)\n\nSo yeah. A mediocre burger with overcooked patties and overcooked price points. And no mustard. The employees saved it from being a one-star review though.\n\nI probably won't be back here anytime in the near future; if I am it will be because someone dragged me there. I'll be the guy with only the Cajun fries, playing with the Coke machine.",---,---,0,False

253,"I am a ten plus year veteran with Carmax and have made a total of 6 purchases through various branches of this business. For over ten years I was fully satisfied with them and always gave them good reviews. My credit is not the best because of a horrible divorce I went through but Carmax has always given me a great interest rate. Last year as a matter of fact at this same Henderson location, I purchased a 2007 Toyota Corolla S and got an outstanding interest rate. Well I am here to tell you that Carmax has reached an all-time low because they DO NOT follow through with their promises.\n\nSaturday afternoon my husband and I went to the Henderson Carmax and met George Baker, Carmax Salesperson. He was helpful in directing us to cars that would meet our needs. He asked if we would be trading in our 1994 Ford Ranger in fair condition to put towards the purchase of the car we decided upon - a 2010 Nissan Versa. George promised us that in the event we found a private buyer for the Ranger that offered more than Carmax's $500 assessed trade in value (WITHIN 5 DAYS of the purchase of our Carmax car), that we could in fact get our trade in back from them. We hastily agreed to the low assessed value of $500 with the intention of checking with a potential private buyer we know to see if he wanted it and getting back with George in the event we were offered more. My husband told George that we would get back with him as soon as we knew anything. We put $1000 cash and $1500 (on our VISA bank card via P.O.S transaction) down on the car, in addition to the $500 trade in value for a total of a $3000 deposit on the Nissan Versa. The car's sticker price was $13,700.\n\nMonday morning (Day 3) at work, I got a phone call from the Carmax cash office saying that we would need to go get the car smogged because it \""""just\"""" expired. \""""Smogged? Doesn't the car come with a smog upon purchase?\"""", I asked. \""""Yes, it does..\"""" the office associate explained, \""""but it somehow just slipped through the cracks.\"""" I was then directed to take time off from work to bring the car into Carmax for a smog before they close at 4pm OR I could go get the car smogged at another smog service provider and get reimbursed.\n\u00a0\nTuesday (Day 4) my husband drove the car to his place of work. He decided to have it smogged at a smog booth close to his work during his lunch break. Upon arrival, the service attendant told him that the Dealer was in fact responsible for the smog by law and that he could not give us the required smog test. At this point we were not feeling very comfortable with the ethics behind this sale. I called Carmax and told them that we were bring the car back because we were still within the 5-Day grace period and we didn't approve of the way things were handled.\n\u00a0\nI was forced to leave work early, do a car switch with my husband and hurry back to Carmax before the cash office closed. Carmax first hassled me about the gas tank not being full, then they slowly processed my return over the period of 3 hours. I asked if our 1994 Ford Ranger trade in was still on the lot so I could get it back since we were told that we could reclaim our trade in as long as it was within 5 days of purchase. Carmax refused to give the Ranger back. They instead gave me a $500 check. I was told that the remainder of my deposit would be mailed to me within 2 weeks, despite their own Policy that states all credit card deposit refunds shall be credited back to the credit card used to make the deposit. They told me that the charge to my VISA was not a credit card transaction. I called my bank and verified that they did in fact make a P.O.S. charge to my VISA card.

I asked him what was going on. His exact reply was, \""""(1/2) If I knew in advance that your plan was to take advantage of a possible return re-purchase, then I would've partnered with a manager concerning your trade.

As he went in back to create the final product, I asked the lady about their store brand juice. She informed me that they use a less balanced percentage of PG and VG (typically its 50/50) but that it makes for a better cloud. She also told me that they use no extra fillers and their juice is simple and pure, flavoring, nicotine and pg and vg. She was really friendly and I didn't feel like she was trying to sell me on her product, she just seemed to be really confidant that theirs was really good and stood out above the rest. She also gave us a great deal on some extra pink spot flavors. The man returned with a glass bottle and their \""""I Heart Vape\"""" logo on the bottle. We made small conversation as they rung us up, and they were really nice people. \n\nWe got in the car and dripped this homemade juice into our vape, and surprise! it was awesome! It was even BETTER than Pink Spot's rip tide and made a really big cloud. I was super impressed! Just to be sure I wasn't imagining this, I dripped some Pink Spot into the vape after it needed to be refilled, and could defintly tell the difference between the two. The I Heart Vape juice tasted much cleaner, less chemically, and was all around delicious. \n\nI don't typically write reviews for Vape shops, but I was so impressed by this one.

All the best of success to your shop!","I wanted to write a review for this shop because I had a really great experience at this one. \nMy boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a weekend trip and we had run out of vape juice. On our way home we looked for the closest vape shop to buy juice for the drive. We really just walked in on a whim with an idea of the juice we wanted and every intention to make a quick fast exit. \nWhen we asked for Riptide Pink Spot juice, they had just sold out of the 6 nicotine bottle; however the friendly owners told us they'd do us one better and make us their own blend of riptide with their own ingredients. We were intrigued, but had to get on the road fast so we told them that we might not have the time. The man told us he'd whip it up for us in two minutes. As he went in back to create the final product, I asked the lady about their store brand juice. She informed me that they use a less balanced percentage of PG and VG (typically its 50/50) but that it makes for a better cloud. She also told me that they use no extra fillers and their juice is simple and pure, flavoring, nicotine and pg and vg.

Whatever it was, I didn't finish it and I'm a big guy.\n\nThe fries are defrosting No effort to even buy real potatoes, peel, and deep fry. They were underdone as well.\n\nFor $7 I guess I should not complain to much but that place but another place down the street for $8 is fantastic and will always choose the other place. At least I tried it for you so you don't have to. I'm sure it's a family place and they are really nice as other reviewers have stated but this place will not last if they can get a gyro out in 2 minutes flat with fries. More effort is needed for fresh ingredients and fresh cut fries.",106,True
275,"To be fair, I'll separate this review into 2 parts: 1 about the food and 2 about the horrendous service.\n\n(((1))) FOOD: 3/5 stars\n$24 per person for the weekday (no seafood) dinner buffet - certainly a better price than the buffets on the strip. The food here was average. I was only able to find a handful of solid items that I could enjoy. Would I come back? Slight chance, but ONLY for the the sashimi salad and the few items I have listed below:\n\n- Salmon sashimi salad - This was the star of the entire dinner. The salmon was extremely buttery, sweet, moist, and fresh. I could just eat this all night and be happy. \n- American beef BBQ ribs - The ribs were meaty, not too dry, and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. It satisfied my rib craving just fine.\n- Chinese style BBQ pork ribs - The Chinese BBQ sauce was sweet and not too salty. The ribs were moist, meaty, and didn't have too much fat, which made it enjoyable. \n- Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) - I enjoyed the flavorful and bold Korean sweet and salty marinade. Some of the meat was tender, but there were also many pieces that were charred to a crispy black.\n- The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was perfectly custardy. \n- The luscious flan had a beautiful smooth texture and not overly sweet.\n- I also enjoyed being able to order Americano and expresso from the dessert bar. They were both light (watery) and not robust, but they were packed with enough caffeine to fight off the food coma.  \n\nThe rest of the food and desserts offered at the buffet were either dried out, overcooked, bland, mushy, or tasted like dishwater. I was also really looking forward to the oysters and crab legs that I've seen in pictures, but alas I didn't see them being offered last night - Note: the seafood buffet is more expensive ($40) and it's only offered Fri-Sat-Sun. \n\n(((2))) SERVICE: 0/5 stars\nThe servers here are shockingly rude and ruined my experience at this buffet and my appetite. \n\nWhen we arrived, the ladies working the front registers advised us that their buffet line will be closing at 9 pm tonight and that's also when the food will stop being refreshed. It was about 7:50 pm, so that wasn't a problem to us - from our understanding, we wouldn't be able to grab anymore food after 9, but we would still be able to finish our meal even after the buffet line was closed. Well, that's typically the case at most buffets...\n\nApparently that's not the case here. What ended up happening was, we grabbed our food, ate, and when 9 pm rolled up, our server abruptly came up to us and said, \""""you have to leave now, we're closed.\"""" Her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional. Mind you, we still had a plate full of food in front of us and we were in the middle of eating (chewing) when she rudely addressed us. I had an obvious look of confusion written all over my face and she then quickly said, \""""I'll give you up to 5 minutes, then you must leave\"""" --- Wow, who talks like that? I was in utter shock that our server was so extremely abrasive. We were just trying to enjoy the rest of our dinner and didn't know that they wanted us out of the restaurant by 9 pm - no one told us that! How does \""""buffet line closes at 9\"""" = \""""you must get out by 9\""""?!\n\nWe quickly tried to finish chewing so we can get the heck out of there and then another gentleman rushed up to us and yelled at us, \""""just to let you know, you have less than 2 minutes to leave.\"""" ---seriously? You can't even approach us with kindness and professionalism? I was beyond infuriated at that point and also still so confused as to how the staff here carried themselves with such poor etiquette. \n\nWith hindsight, I understand that it was major negligent miscommunication between the staff and my party, but even so, that's never an appropriate reason to mistreat your guests or speak to them like they are livestock. \n\nAlso, to rub a pound of salt into our wounds - I didn't even know we could have unlimited beer/wine during our buffet - none of the servers or staff informed us. I just ordered a coke and our waitress never even came back to refill it! My glass was empty 15 minutes into eating there and I had to get up and go look for her and ask her if I may get a refill. Of course she forgot to refill it, so I had to get another server to refill it for me. Finally, my server waltzes up with my refilled coke.

276,"I ate here for the second time during a recent trip to Las Vegas. The first time was over a year ago when a girlfriend and I opted for the 24 hour pass. We really enjoyed the Planet Hollywood buffet and everything it had to offer, so when my boyfriend said he wanted to try a buffet on his first trip to Vegas last weekend, I knew we would have to come here. The price is fair considering the cost of food on the strip and the selection you get here. We also paid the additional $24 to jump the line as it was HUGE and we were starving. With my Players Club card that I signed up for the first time, we got a nice little discount and were seated right away. We quickly ventured off to see what they were offering. Crab legs galore (which they topped up regularly and were nice and hot), a great seafood selection, Italian food (including pizza), American offerings, Middle Eastern, Asian, Mexican, and a great salad and dessert bar. After about 12 plates each of food, we were thoroughly satisfied! If you're looking for a good buffet in Vegas at a moderate price point, Spice Market is your best bet. We might try the Bellagio or Wynn buffet next time, but I highly recommend this one!","I ate here for the second time during a recent trip to Las Vegas.

Customer service, although not required is definitely appreciated and noted to make a world of difference.\n\nAllow me to relay my adventure the first night in Sin City. . . .\n\nThere were six of us, all beautiful girls, enjoying ourselves.  We went out to dinner, we enjoyed a show, we got dolled up and we were ready for some dancing action.  Being a group of beautiful girls, all we had to do to was show a little leg to get into the hottest clubs on the strip.\n\nI got lost in the music, dancing and alcohol for hours before I realized that I was missing something essential in my small dancing purse.  Dude where's my wallet and phone?!?!  Snapped out of my intoxicated haze, I patrolled the club and harrassed security with no luck.  With nothing left to do, I returned to the Venetian tired and defeated.\n\nMy exhausted group decided to go back to the room while I inquire at the front desk about a business center.  I am a responsible mature young lady; I needed to notify my five credit/debit cards that my wallet was missing.\n\nThe front desk lady, whose name I did not catch, was Caucasian with medium long hair, tall, thin and working the hours between 3-4 am deserves an award and to be recognized.  When I told her of my misfortune, she not only found all five customer service numbers on her computer, dialed the numbers for me and waited patiently as I struggled to talk to ppl who may not reside in the country.  Once I had my card situation figured out, I had the audacity to ask if she can call long distance to my boyfriend so I can let him know that I am unavailable. . lost phone and all.\n\nThere could never be a more appreciative drunken fool to have stumbled through the Venetian than me that night.  Yes the Venetian is a beautiful facility with great rooms and a central location on the strip, but it is that lady who has earned my loyalty.\n\nA word about the room. . . We stayed in the Rialto suite - two full size beds, pull out sectional, two TVs.  The bathroom is large, separate shower and bath tub and private room for toilet. \n\nDon't worry, some extremely good samaritan turned in my phone/wallet to security with ID, cash and credit card intact.  The rest of my trip was salvaged and there are now permanent indentations on my phone/wallet from my death grip.",---,---,0,False

364,"This place is horrible! Let me first say that I have gone to the babystacks on buffalo too many times to count and I love it. The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fianc\u00e9 and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fianc\u00e9 was done with his meal.

I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah.

Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic.

369,"We had dinner at Hillstone a couple nights ago.  The food was, for the most part, pretty good.  However, the service was below average.  They really need to work on training their servers better or they will lose a lot of potential repeat business.   We showed up at 7:30 and our reservation was for 8pm.  We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio (which was very nice as far as scenery/ambience).  It was awhile before a server came over to take our drink orders; we saw her go by/near tables next to us twice before she finally came over.  She made us feel rushed from the get-go; as if she was in a hurry -- it was a little strange for the relaxed atmosphere and mode we were in.  She brought us our drinks - never offered water - and when she didn't come back for awhile, my husband got up to get me water from the bar.  She soon brought a check over and we at that point said we'd like to order an appetizer.  Again, she seemed a little \""""put out\"""" by us, but took the order.  When we were halfway through our spinach dip, at about 7:50, a hostess came over and moved us indoors to our table that was \""""ready.\"""". It would have been much nicer to finish the appetizer where we were, and then have us move inside, rather than transporting everything.  Kind of strange.  There were also several tables inside - it wasn't packed with a line of people waiting or anything.\n\nOnce inside, our next server (this seemed like #3 already, of what would be about 6 total servers throughout our evening) came by and was sort of awkward - saw we had half eaten spinach dip and said \""""looks like your all set, I'll let you enjoy that,\"""" without asking if there was anything else we needed at that time...again, no offer of WATER!  I asked for ice water, and she then looked to my husband...\""""Did you want some, too?\""""...OF COURSE.  Isn't that just a matter of course here in Phoenix, early September?  We were asked within a couple of minutes if we were ready to order and we hadn't even picked up the menus yet...we were talking, eating spinach dip, having drinks...again, very much a RUSHED feeling.\nWe ordered ribs which come with \""""hand cut potato fries and coleslaw.\"""" I said I would prefer a baked potato instead of hand cut fries.  The server's EXACT response: \""""Okay.\""""  Pause... \""""But then you won't get the coleslaw either.  The baked potato counts as two sides.\"""" Um, okay...I suddenly felt like I was ordering at a fast food restaurant.  Blown away.  I said nothing; I really didn't care about having coleslaw anyways.  My husband next ordered, also with a baked potato replacing the fries, but he said \""""And I'd like to have my coleslaw please.\""""  Server response: \""""Okay, it will be $4.00 for the coleslaw.\"""" Again, wow.  Where am I?  Certainly not an upscale restaurant...can we supersize here??!\n\nOur ribs were good; we were enjoying the food (again, for the most part...good, not great).  What happened next however, was that no less than 3 random servers came by in about a 12 minute period, none of whom were our original server, asking if we were done and if they could take our plates.  We were so far from done - I had about 75% of my meal still on my plate and my husband, while he was almost done with his ribs, was still working on the baked potato and the $4.00 *supposed to be included with meal* coleslaw.  It was so incredibly annoying; they kept interrupting our conversation and what was trying to be a relaxing, enjoyable evening out.  We finally gave in and said we were done (server number 6 asking)...who were these people?  Why isn't one server and one busser assigned to each table?  That way the same question wouldn't be asked 6 times...they've got to work on this.\n\nYet a different server came to see if we wanted anything else; my husband had to ASK for a dessert menu (it was not offered), and when he asked, server #7 (?) pretty much ignored the question and said \""""Let me tell you...\"""" and started rambling off I think four different desserts.  This would be fine, I suppose (even though I really prefer to read it from a menu and make my decision...a little more time, less pressure..) but we couldn't understand what she was saying was on top of the hot fudge sundae.  The place is a little loud...my husband asked her to repeat it, we both still missed it...I asked again...\""""What's on top of the sundae?\"""" And again, we both missed it.  Could not understand..whatever, this is why I'd like a dessert menu to READ.  I finally said, \""""We'll have the key lime pie,\"""" because we both still had no clue what might come on top of that sundae if we ordered it!\n\nThe key lime pie was disappointing.  We shared a piece and between the two of us we did not even finish half of it.  The crust had cinnamon in it, which tasted so wrong with key lime pie.  The kind of crust you would use for a pumpkin pie.  \n\nAll in all, not rushing back to Hillstone anytime soon.  They have got to work on the wait staff.

374,"This is one of my favorite south Tempe haunts of late!  It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location.  The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!

If you haven't had a pasty yet, you should!!","This is one of my favorite south Tempe haunts of late! It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location. The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight! Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ. Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try! For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger. There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone. Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!

I usually only come here if my friends from out of town insist on going here, I just can't stomach it anymore. \n\n Tried to go to Jitter's last night with some friends (Jitter's & Lucky's are both owned by the same miserable owner & have the same address), and was turned away at the door. We were told that this was a \""""members only party, by invitation only and a private party\"""" and they refused to let us in. I have been to Jitter's too many times to count, and have NEVER had a problem getting in. But last night was also the first time I didn't walk in with any of my white friends. Those same white friends were actually in Jitter's WAITING for us, and they were NOT told the same excuse abt it being \""""members only\"""". They showed their ID, paid the cover and walked right in. So this was obvisiously a blatent example of racial discrimination. They should be lucky that anybody even wanted to go into their hole-in-the-wall bar (that is literally the basement of some raggedy old house) underneath a bridge. It's not really my scene anyway because their is always too many underage-looking kids in their openly sniffing coke, but I've had fun there only because it's the only thing left thats open & nobody is ready to go home yet. \n\n I wish there was a NEGATIVE star rating that I could give this place, soley based off the way that we were treated last night. Although, I shouldn't be surprised since I have had similar problems in going to Lucky's & they are owned by the same people.

Everything else was just a bonus. We had a slice of the lemon cake which was good but a little too sweet for me. It was more than enough for five people.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. I highly recommend Del Frisco's to anyone willing to try it. Who cares about the price... you only live once. I can't wait to go back, my mouth waters just thinking about it....",5000,False
417,I have been to this place twice and both times had bad experiences. First time I went in as a walk in at 10am with my daughter. The man who helped us said they could not take us as they were pretty busy. Totally understandable considering it was a Saturday. But it was the way he treated us that was very poor. I get that you are too busy to take us but how about exercising a little customer service and helping us schedule a later time or next day. He was very rude and dismissive. It was kind of embarrassing considering there was people all around us. Despite this we decided to try again the next day. I called and made an appt with the man who answered the phone. Not sure if it was same guy. We made it for last appt of the day. When we arrived two young ladies greeted us but could not find our appt. again instead of trying to accommodate us they just said we didn't have an appt so they couldn't take us. Then they said that we called the wrong salon. I tried to show them the number I called on my phone log but they refused to look at it. I checked it with the number on the store brochure and window and I had called the correct store. I told them this but no answer. Again no one tried to reschedule or even apologize for the confusion. I have been to many nail salons in different states and have never been treated so bad. Also this salon had one of the strongest product smells that I have ever experienced. I'm thinkin it all worked out for the best. Found a great place down the road.,I have been to this place twice and both times had bad experiences.

He had this amazing looking needlefish or sayari. I never had before but said that few times. They have boards with different fish gets in every week everyone talks about the uni. Unfortunately they did not have it. =( The sayari sashimi style knowing literally cut fresh off the bone. It served with quail egg mixed together was perfect balance. It same came too sweet shrimp. Deep fry the head good stuff dipped in the sauce. Sayari bones too! Every sushi was amazing flavors, depth, and stuff like scallops never had in sushi restaurant. Scallops that blew my mind! Fresh Oysters combine with the sauce like slurp of sea heaven. Every sushi was more and more amazing. We ended it with american kobe beef roll that by far best speciality rolls EVER! Me more about the nigiri style sushi. It true sushi for me all about the quality of the fish and rice. Sushi in its truest form. Desserts we had the deep fried plum and black sesame seed ice cream. The plum had much more flavor then I could ever imagine. The crispy goodness outside mixed with the plum ice cream very nice. The black sesame seed honestly not fan of. I think that sesame seed in ice cream not meant too be just weird flavor. \n\nThe whole time thinking of Jiro \""""dreams of sushi\"""".  I did have one roll.

426,"This review is for the convention / meeting room facilities. And I am NOT IMPRESSED. In many other cities the Rio's convention and meeting room facilities would be considered downright opulent and something a city would be proud to have for hosting events. In Vegas, it's like yawn, been there, done that, it's a little dated and not all that. \n\nService: Hustle was the word of the day for our visit from the manager we directly worked with. Got service with a smile too. When a technical difficulty came up their IT staff was on the ball with a quick response. I always love that and give it mad praise when you get that kind of service. \n\nFood: The food was average. Pretty to look at, slow to get on the table, servers didn't pay attention and were sloppy in getting food on and off the tables and it is insulting to tea to lump their so called offering into the category of tea. Bleech. \n\nBut that's where the positive comments come to a halt. Seriously if you're paying premium money to rent a room for an event and they roll out a cheap projector that is broken to the point they put a 9 volt battery under one corner of it so it would project a level image onto the screen? Seriously? Of all the comps I've ever received in Vegas, a 9 volt battery to fix junk equipment is the worst on the list. (See the picture, you can't make this stuff up.)\n\nIf you forget a clicker for your Powerpoint, it's a cool $125 a day rental for something I could have bought for half price had I had the time to grab a cab and run to Fry's to buy one (including the cab fare and cabbie tip). I ended up making changes so it wasn't needed but the price they quoted takes \""""FLEECING\"""" to a whole other level. \n\nWhen I compare the Gold Coast to the Rio in terms of price vs. square footage, quality of the space, quality of the A/V equipment, and yes even the staff, the Gold Coast quite frankly kicks the Rio's ass HARD. Anyone renting space for a meeting and considering the Rio needs to think long and hard about it as most likely they are not receiving the best value for their money. \n\n2 Stars, and even the second star is one I'm on the fence about giving. But a placement on my Jackassery list is a must. As yes, I think sticking a braying jackass in place of the Rio's management team would do a better job of handling this place. (Again our one on site rep who I can't name was awesome considering she was working with crappy equipment). Oh and the extra valet we paid for...can someone give those guys some 5 hour energy before letting them loose to retrieve cars? Yeah, not happy. We deserve better.

For $4 you get two stuffed chicken wings, which I found pretty delicious, but I would probably never order them again.\n\nI ended up saving the pa-naeng for a second meal. It was a little thick coming out of the fridge so I added a little bit of water and some broccoli/sweet peas which made the curry just perfect!! I'm really glad my friend recommended it!\n\nI can't wait to be back to try more of the menu!",5000,False

We made a reservation through opentable.com, expressing that we were locals and it was our wedding anniversary.\n\nThe Downstairs definitely has a very different ambiance than the Upstairs. Downstairs is open and has more of a sports bar feel in some ways. Whereas Upstairs is definitely an upscale restaurant atmosphere.\n\nWe had done our research ahead of time and already knew exactly what we wanted to order. We started off with the oysters rockefeller. I'm not a fan of oysters generally (though, my husband is), but these were incredibly delicious. The flavors were amazing.\n\nWe then progressed to the Ebi-Go sushi roll. All of the sushi rolls sounded great, so it was difficult to choose. The Ebi-Go roll totally delivered, though. Excellent flavors and great presentation.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the ribeye with bernaise sauce and the hand-made cavatelli with morel mushrooms and blue crab. Being a huge fan of bernaise sauce, I can be a rather harsh critic when it comes this sauce. RM's bernaise did not disappoint. In fact, it was one of the better bernaise sauces I've ever had. The pasta dish was also great. It was almost more like gnocchi and the mushrooms and crab paired incredibly together. \n\nFor a side, we opted for the BBQ-style mac 'n' cheese. The flavors were explosive. The BBQ meat with the peppers was awesome. Definitely one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas.\n\nFor dessert, we of course had to go with Rick's Tasting Game. It was such a fun way to end the meal. We thought we'd nail it, but it is amazing how much not knowing what it is can screw with your taste buds.\n\nGiven that it was a holiday weekend, the restaurant was pretty crowded and busy. However, we found the service to be good and never felt rushed.\n\nThe server brought our check. We inserted our gift certificate and credit card. Server brought it back. We signed the receipt. We left.\n\nSince it was our anniversary, I promised my husband that I would separate myself from my crackberry for the evening. And I stuck to that for the most part.

Overboard much? \n\nAnd the only reason he had my cell number was because we made the reservation through opentable.com, where we stated we were locals and it was our anniversary. So that made me even more livid.\n\nWe made our way back to RM and the issue was fixed. Thankfully, the hostess was incredibly nice and apologized repeatedly for the server.\n\nSo while the food would warrant a 5-star rating (and did cement in place my crush on Rick Moonen), the 17 calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails makes me deduct a star out of sheer irritation.","We had a restaurant.com gift certificate for RM Seafood Downstairs and decided to use it for our anniversary.

Overboard much? \n\nAnd the only reason he had my cell number was because we made the reservation through opentable.com, where we stated we were locals and it was our anniversary. So that made me even more livid.\n\nWe made our way back to RM and the issue was fixed. Thankfully, the hostess was incredibly nice and apologized repeatedly for the server.\n\nSo while the food would warrant a 5-star rating (and did cement in place my crush on Rick Moonen), the 17 calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails makes me deduct a star out of sheer irritation.","We had a restaurant.com gift certificate for RM Seafood Downstairs and decided to use it for our anniversary. We made a reservation through opentable.com, expressing that we were locals and it was our wedding anniversary.\n\nThe Downstairs definitely has a very different ambiance than the Upstairs. Downstairs is open and has more of a sports bar feel in some ways. Whereas Upstairs is definitely an upscale restaurant atmosphere.\n\nWe had done our research ahead of time and already knew exactly what we wanted to order. We started off with the oysters rockefeller. I'm not a fan of oysters generally (though, my husband is), but these were incredibly delicious. The flavors were amazing.\n\nWe then progressed to the Ebi-Go sushi roll. All of the sushi rolls sounded great, so it was difficult to choose. The Ebi-Go roll totally delivered, though. Excellent flavors and great presentation.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the ribeye with bernaise sauce and the hand-made cavatelli with morel mushrooms and blue crab. Being a huge fan of bernaise sauce, I can be a rather harsh critic when it comes this sauce. RM's bernaise did not disappoint. In fact, it was one of the better bernaise sauces I've ever had. The pasta dish was also great. It was almost more like gnocchi and the mushrooms and crab paired incredibly together. \n\nFor a side, we opted for the BBQ-style mac 'n' cheese. The flavors were explosive. The BBQ meat with the peppers was awesome. Definitely one of the best mac 'n' cheese dishes in Vegas.\n\nFor dessert, we of course had to go with Rick's Tasting Game. It was such a fun way to end the meal. We thought we'd nail it, but it is amazing how much not knowing what it is can screw with your taste buds.\n\nGiven that it was a holiday weekend, the restaurant was pretty crowded and busy. However, we found the service to be good and never felt rushed.\n\nThe server brought our check. We inserted our gift certificate and credit card. Server brought it back. We signed the receipt. We left.\n\nSince it was our anniversary, I promised my husband that I would separate myself from my crackberry for the evening. And I stuck to that for the most part. Though, a few hours later, when my husband took a restroom break, I sneaked a peak. \n\nI had 17 missed calls, 11 texts, and 6 voicemails. All from our server.

But he was willing to keep us busy with running drills, a little weights and such, but nothing boxing related. (again not his fault) he was great. But I definitely returned my groupon because the 1on1 boxing instructor definitely went bother to honor his own conditions. I even called him the next day to confirm that he would be there and he said of course he would. So I mentioned that I was a part of the group from that morning when he didn't show up and he said \""""oh...well you were trained by (other trainers name).\"""" I thought that was a poor excuse.",115,True

555,"I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that the best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much the restaurant relies on the celeb's name rather than the food to get people in the door.\n\nMy friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind the hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in the restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past the open kitchen where the chef manning the grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  The table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped the other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having the conversation I wanted to have with my friend there.\n\nOur waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us the day's specials.  \""""Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on the food network?\"""" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  The Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were the ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.\n\nMy biggest complaint about Mesa, and the reason I only give it one star, is the seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.\n\nWe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way I can imagine.  \""""Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?\"""" she demanded.  \""""Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\"""" I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nFunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \""""It's ok,\"""" which is about how I felt.  She shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy.\n\nMy salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was \""""ok.\""""  Maybe the dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out.","I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.

It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder. I love lamb because it tastes good. Why go against that? About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate. He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.\n\nWe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter. He came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way I can imagine. \""""Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?\"""" she demanded. \""""Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\"""" I replied. Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable. I get it. Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that. The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nFunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \""""It's ok,\"""" which is about how I felt. She shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy.\n\nMy salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was \""""ok.\"""" Maybe the dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out.","I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.

The aquarium is HUGE and consists of 3 different buildings. The giraffe feeding exhibit is awesome and was my kids fave. Bring quarters for the food machines. They had 1 huge giraffe that just loved all the attention and 2 smaller ones extending their necks out trying to get food. They were sooo cute. We saw a little joey in a pouch of a kangaroo, and we got to feed the lourey birds at 3. The petting zoo was alot of fun too. The Phx Zoo does not have this much interaction at all. Only thing missing was an elephant but we got to see the huge rhino up close, he was only about 20 feet away.

It's like getting a tasting menu as you'll get quite a good variety of staple Indian dishes. Overall, I'd eat here again. You get so much eating satisfaction for the money.",3695,True

688,"I went here due to my curiosity of the blend between rock music and the typical Scottsdale venue. Based upon my first experience, this place has potential - unlike the band I listened too.. but they at least had some passion.. no, that's not the word.. delusion, but enough about them. \n\nI paid a cover to see a few bands, out of none I have ever heard of.. and most likely never will. I sat down at the bar and the girl behind the bar lip read my order (due to the high volume), and she did it flawlessly. I was very impressed. \n\nThe place itself is nice enough, and I am a big fan of the fact that you can sit outside on the other side of the bar. When it comes to the clientele there is a clash, because the establishment does not attract the real metal fans out there, but instead a glam-version of such. The people that want the grit of the image but still enjoy a decent cocktail. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it, and yet it does amuse me. \n\nOverall I will give this place another shot, because it has great potential.. and since I imagine the clientele and atmosphere changes with the band, I might have just caught a slow night. \n\n*** For you metalheads out there.

Second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so It was worth the wait for me. When the food came out I was ready baby!!! AND THE FIRST BITE.....hmm not that good. I got the grilled French toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. I get biscuits everywhere I go just to try everyone's and find the best. This place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. Let's move to the French toast, I understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 HUGE pieces of French toast. Only come here if you are already drunk, I think it would be pretty good then but so is Waffle House. Friendly staff though","Surprisingly below average.

I've seen many of the cirque shows here in Vegas over the years (e.g., Ka, Mystere, O, etc.) and I'm not sure why this show has bad reviews. Right from the beginning this experience was great. We were fortunate to get tickets closer to the front and I have got to say that these were the most comfortable seats.. they were wider and just plain pleasant to sit in. Right before the show started, like most cirque shows, they had the actors come out to entertain the crowd which was really fun. One of the actors who was carrying a spell book of some sort was given some popcorn by an audience member. He put a kernel on a guys head and wouldn't let him take it off even while he was walking away. It was really funny and a 'you had to have been there' type of thing. There were other funny things going on around the theater too. \n\nThe show had some really good acts. I especially enjoyed the juggler, she was also kind of feisty and worked the crowd well with a few eyebrow flicks and a smile. The sand artist was excellent as well, she was so quick and the pictures she created were beautiful. Like a typical cirque show it had a lot of acrobats and high flying acts and of course they were extremely talented and fun to watch. Sure the show is light on story but the acts are all top notch. \n\nTo sum up, if you want to watch a good cirque show in Vegas with great acrobatics and artistry and don't mind little story this would be a fun one to go and see.

692,"On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.\n\nThe appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.\n\nThe most notable things were:\n\nShopska salad\n-It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.\n\nCevape\n-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.\n\nArtisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate\n-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks\n\nLeskovacka pljeskavica\n-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger\n\nThere were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.\n\nSo why the poor rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.\n\nOur waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.\n\nWe got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.\n\nThe Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.\n\nI'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \""""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\"""" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.\n\nThe Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.\n\nThe Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \""""Is this corned beef?\"""" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.\n\nSo now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.\n\nThis still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.\n\nIf your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.",---,---,0,False

Not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in, but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that I have to wait another day to move in because the office is closed. We had this move in date set for 3 months. Now this may not be an issue to many people, but it was a problem for me because I moved from Chicago. I needed to move in the day I was planning on because I had no where else to stay. That was just the beginning though... \n\n1.) We realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over $500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay. They did inform us that we paid $420 over. However, after reviewing the statement the office gave us, which included everything we were charged and have paid, it made no sense. Basically, we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged one time and all of the math was wrong. The amount they owe us just kept adding up. \n\n\n2.) We have ZERO cell service in our apartment. It is a complete dead zone. My roommate and I are also not the only ones with this issue. We have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service. This may not be the staff's problem, which we understand, but it sucks that I have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place I can get MAYBE 2 bars on my phone.\n\n\n3.) The next issue, which we have ben dealing with for about a week now, is our cable. The day we moved in the staff in the office told us that we can get Cox or DirecTV. We decided on DirecTV. The morning the man came to install it, he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenance people opened them. My roommate and I went straight to the office to ask if they could open the things on the roof. They told us it would be a half hour, so we had to send the DirecTV man away so we could make his other appointment. FOUR HOURS LATER, the maintenance people still had not fixed anything. I went and asked the office if it was finished yet and the lady helping me didn't even think to call the maintenance people to ask, she only thought to e-mail them.

He told us that the maintenance people only opened one of the things on the roof and not all of them. When we went to ask the maintenance people to finish their original task, they were extremely rude to us.

I find this completely ridiculous!! We shouldn't have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment. Also, the maintenance people should have done everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to.

696,"I was excited to come here, especially since it was in the City Center at the Aria Hotel. Our friend Cassie had a friend that was promoting this club that night and so he got all the girls in for free and the guys had to pay $10, which is definitely a deal. \n\nWhen we got in, we had our pictures taken and then proceeded to the bar to get drinks. They were pricey! $14 for a fuzzy navel and $12 for a Heineken!! (I thought that was over the top, especially for this club, but what could you do? I would say drink a lot before and then get a drink or 2 here) The place was nicely decorated, and there were VIP/Bottle Service seats all around. My group stayed behind the bar in one of the corners (we had a group of 17) so we needed space. \n\nThe music was ALL trance-like. The DJ would trick us with playing out a good song for like 3-5 seconds and then mess it up and play more trance. It was cool at first, but then it got old and we wanted more of a variety. Some of the girls feet were hurting so we sat down and then got told we couldn't sit down because it was reserved for bottle service.

708,"Yelpers all know by now that I'm a 4th generation Japanese-American. But, what many of you don't know is that my Mom is actually Korean.  A significant reason I choose to identify as  Japanese over Korean was because since my childhood the Korean community has always rejected me. I just turned out way too Japanese looking, and my Korean features are philosophically just an non-observable genotype.  No matter how hard I tried to reach out to the Korean community, I was always pushed away.  I've probably only gotten along with 5-6 Korean people in my lifetime, and most of them were Zainichi Koreans or Koreans from South America. Because the Korean community pushed me away my whole life, I grew up not knowing anything about Korean cuisine. So I don't know if SURA is considered \""""good Korean food\"""" by Korean people, but what matters is that I enjoyed every second of it. \n\nOf course my favorite Korean BBQ joint is and always will be Mr. Jake Lee's Honey Pig, but SURA has some advantages. The main advantage(and maybe the only advantage) is that SURA is a buffet style restaurant and you don't have to wait for a server to bring you more meat. Personally, I like Honey Pig better because they accommodate Japanese people and will give you Yakiniku style meat if you ask the right person.  Also at Honey Pig they cook the meat for you, so you can just sit back and relax. The first time I came to SURA, I badly burned everything causing a lot of black smoke to fill up the area. The server ran over.... and she looked really really pissed. \n\nI really liked the Kalbi here. I also really liked the pork bulgogi. You can tell it's been marinated over night because of the intense flavor. Even the California rolls were pretty good, and I don't even like California rolls. \n\nI'm actually surprised this place has such a high yelp rating because I've noticed that most Korean yelpers tend to give out a lot of 1-star ratings to Korean owned businesses.  They always complain about how the food is not as good as it is in Korea or \""""Ellie\""""(note- \""""Ellie\"""" is how a lot of FOB Koreans pronounce L.A.).  I'm giving this place 5-stars because unlike full-Koreans, I actually support Korean business. btw... why is it that every Korean person has an Iphone 5? Shouldn't you guys support Korea and buy the Samsung Galaxy? How unpatriotic!\n\nmy reviews are weird",---,---,0,False

My colleague and I wanted to try everything but opted for some house recommendations: the Cappesante (seared maine diver scallop, with a light celery and kumquat salad); freshmade rigatoni and agnolotti; and tiramisu the Sinatra way.\n\nThe flavor contrast between courses, as recommended by our server, was much appreciated. The Cappesante delivered a delicious, clean punch. And our server, without even having been asked, split the flavorful rigatoni and agnolotti for us (so thoughtful and much more elegant than if we were to dig in each other's plates from across the table!). The tiramisu is something not to be missed. \n\nThis is a place that I would certainly want to make a return visit to on my next trip to Las Vegas.",5000,False

773,We heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. The menu looked amazing and we came hungry. I ordered kalua pig Benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with Mac salad. Both were not good at all! The kalua pig Benedict was kalua pig and CABBAGE Benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the English muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. The adobo fried rice was junk. If you are from Hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. We thought aloha kitchen AFR was junk this was worse. The Mac salad was DISGUSTING to say the very least. It had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. It was like soaked (not boiled) macaroni in a watery white substance. I gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. We also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for $2.75 that tasted good (like zippys chili) so our bill came out to $47 and some cents and we were Very Very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.,We heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it.

774,"I'll start by saying I really wanted to like this place because the beer selection had me giddy and the food was definitely decent, albeit kind of expensive for the ASU neighborhood. The pizza was better than the rest of what I sampled from the menu but unfortunately, the service was horrendous. \nWe went towards the end of a celebration involving beer that the town was having and it was Saturday night so we expected it to be on the busier side. The bar area was loud thanks to an excessively high music volume (I promise I'm not just old and grumpy) and people getting their buzz on. It was a little disorienting and it didn't allow my friends and I to carry on a conversation, but it's not a big deal. It's a college bar/restaurant, after all. The servers, as well as the bartender (who seemed to be serving and talking with the same few people, getting them one drink after another, while neglecting everyone else), were clearly inattentive and probably overworked. It looked to me like everyone had too much on their plates and none of them seemed to be on top of things. They were too laid back (read: spacey) or too exhausted to take on the steady stream of customers coming in after us as well as keeping up with existing customers. Another employee (preferably an alert one) thrown into the mix would have made a world of difference,\nAfter not seeing our server around for awhile, I made the mistake of ordering a beer with the guy who brought us our food. I passed him my ID to take a look at, watched him jot my drink order down, and to my dismay, he was never to be seen again. Wait, I take that back. I was just reminded that we saw him again when he was hanging out and chatting with friends outside. What a coincidence that he was ready to go back inside (in a hurry) just as we made eye contact while leaving the restaurant! When our waitress did eventually come around to see if we were ready for the check, I mentioned my long lost beer and she confessed she hadn't received word of it but was not apologetic, which would have improved the situation for me. It took a bit longer but I received my beer and my check, which of course is a disconcerting combination when I had initially wanted said beer just moments after ordering our food. I drank it quickly in an effort to make our way out of the place in a timely manner but regretted not getting to savor it happily with my meal. Another thing I want to mention (with has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant's service or the food) is the fact that their water is not purified. This is a non-issue for me in Albuquerque but the tap water in Phoenix tastes remarkably like pond scum to non-Natives such as myself who are well adjusted to better quality water from the tap.

During winter, for some reason, there is 1 chance out of 4 that they simply DO NOT pass. No, not that they are late by 5 minutes... they simply DO NOT COME. Once I waited for 2 425s in a row and a 217. NOBODY came and I just decided to go back home and skip class. I came late to work 3 times in 3 months because the 419 was not there and I ran to the 217 bus to get to work late. It's AWFUL.\n\nSecond of all, the drivers man... ha ha... Fuck. The 419 driver in the morning of Wednesday (12-11-13) who was not only late 10 minutes but also took the wrong turn following the 219 route and ended up doing a 15 minute detour to get to Fairview got me late for work. When I confronted him, he replied with \""""Hey, it happens, what do you want me to do?\"""". Oh, I don't know. Maybeeeeeeee NOT READ THE JOURNAL WHILE YOU DRIVE. FUCKING RETARD. \n\nBelieve I'm pulling this out of my ass, here, have a picture.\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1.0-9/1525254_10153618305210103_773641187_n.jpg\n\nI complained to the STM by email. I simply got a big fat \""""lol ok\"""" from them. This is what happens when you have the monopole of something.\n\nI had bus drivers on numerous occasions that stopped in the middle of the fucking street to get something to eat at a dep! Thank you 217 bus driver for showing me that the STM sucks twice in a month.

Yay!!! Free yummy food all night. Since we were a large group, we had our own lil room with large portraits of unknown men (two to be exact)....the bf mentioned that it was a $3,000 minimum that needed to be spent. \n\nWe all started off with drinks....my Riesling was not too dry and that's the kind of wine I like. The bf's boss ordered the Coldshell Fish Platter, Pan Fried Calamari and Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarella. My favorite out of all of those was the Fried Calamari. I loved how it was a lil spicy, crispy and oh so delicious! YUM! The oysters were HUGE....almost the size of my palm. Everything else was good, but the calamari is what stood out in my mind. \n\nFor an entree, I decided to go with Seared Tenderloin with the Butter Poached Lobster and a cup of the Clam Chowder. The bf ordered some kind of steak and the Lobster Bisque. This lady at the table was raving about the Lobster Bisque and how it had real chunks of lobster in it. The soups and salads arrived fairly quickly and let's just note that the Lobster Bisque....not so awesome. Clam Chowder was definitely WAY better than the bisque. My beef tenderloins were tender and I believe there were 3 or 4 tenderloins plus the lobster. I thought it was tender and tasty, nothing too special. Lobster was cooked well and was very buttery. I was extremely full by the time my tenderloins came out so I'm not sure I appreciated it to its full extent. \n\nFor the sides, we shared everything family style. Creamed Spinach, Parmesan truffle fries, Sam's Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Fresh Asparagus with Hollaindaise Sauce, Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms and Au Gratin Potatoes was what was ordered. Out of everything I really loved the Sam's Mashed Potatoes and the Creamed Spinach. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was probably my least favorite....not very flavorful and just not what I expected it to be.

Your ID *will* be checked - depending on how young you look, maybe a few times. Saw someone kicked out of line for having an expired DL too, so make sure you have a good one! There were people in line with tickets for the night ($30)... So, that doesn't get you in any faster FYI. \n\nDRESS CODE...\n\nGuys... There is a sign that states \""""dress code strictly enforced.\"""" I knew I was good... Figure if i can dress appropriately, everyone else should, right? WRONG! There were guys in line that got in wearing cheap solid color t-shirts, sleeveless t-shirts, and even tank tops. A few got in wearing polo shirts (borderline for a \""""high end\"""" club if you ask me). Guys - wear a button-down shirt for goodness sakes! Ladies were mostly dressed appropriately for the scene - but, I haven't been to many clubs where the ladies do not know how to dress. \n\nGETTING INSIDE...\n\nAfter you are \""""checked off\"""" the guest list, you approach another (final) ID check. Your wrist is stamped a second time and you are ushered to the register to pay to get in. Yes, we were on the guest list and didn't have to pay that night - the people that check you off earlier in line, issue you a \""""pass\"""" telling the cashier how many males vs. females in your party. You turn in that paper are handed a receipt, and then ushered into a bank of elevators which they pack shoulder to shoulder... Ugh! \n\nONCE INSIDE...\n\nThe elevator doors opened on the 4th floor and in you go to a hallway leading up a couple of stairs to the dance area. The first thing I noticed is the relatively small (read - packed) dance floor. The dance area is surrounded by VIP tables/booths. There are a few bars around the outskirts of the floor/VIP area. As for decor, well... I think a friend put it best in reaction to a video I posted on Instagram... It looks like a black box with lights inside!\n\nIf you are not a smoker, beware - you will get smoke in your face in this place. Sometimes you are walking along and poof! you walk into a cloud of smoke thanks to another patron. \n\nWe also explored the 5th floor, figuring one could look down on the dance floor below and see the DJ, etc. Another disappointment here... Once you get upstairs, the only way to look down on the floor and see the DJ, is if you have one of the VIP tables/booths up there. Otherwise, you are at least 6-8' back from the overlook and can't see anything really. \n\nBAR...\n\nIt's Vegas, so I figured it would be around $14-16 for a drink here. Ordered 2 goose with pineapple = $40 including tip. The \""""glass\"""" tumbler is plastic (I've been to \""""cheaper\"""" clubs and they serve in actual glass - guess this place \""""can't afford\"""" the glass??? As for the alcohol to mixer content - I would say it was average. Not terrible, but not $20 worth in my book. \n\nBATHROOM...\n\nYou would think that a place the size of this one would have a decent restroom facility. I am sad to say that NO, it doesn't - at least the one I went to. Once you get inside the bathroom, an attendant pretty much keeps things in check and\""""assigns\"""" you a urinal or stall based on availability... Sound great, except that there were only 3 urinals and two stall that I remember seeing. Once done, the attendants are extremely courteous and do their job really well - tip them, as it may be the only thing that actually worked well!\n\nOVERALL...\n\nI would NOT go again, unless there is a special event going on where I know I will see a favorite DJ. Even then, I would be hard pressed to pay for a ticket or be on a VIP guest list. The only way to do this place right is probably to get a table, and from what I understood is definitely in the thousand$. \n\nCan't wait to get back to Miami to go to a real nightclub!",5000,False

835,"Our flight arrived to Vegas earlier than excepted, so we expected our room not to be ready. When we arrived at the hotel on May 19th, the front desk girl offered us a room that was ready on the 28th floor that wasn't facing the Bellagio fountain. I booked a corner view suite had requested a room on a high floor with a Bellagio fountain view when I first made the reservation. There are 56 floors at the hotel. She then said there was a room on the 30th floor with a view of the Bellagio fountain, but it wasn't ready. She continued to look for rooms, which she then said that there was a room on the 50th room with a Bellagio fountain view, but it wasn't ready yet either. We agreed to wait for that room to be cleaned, which she said it would be couple of hours before it would be ready. We waited a couple of hours by walking around the area before calling to check to see if the room was ready yet. I was transferred to housekeeping, who said it wasn't ready yet and they would call me back when it was. After eating and walking around some more for a couple more hours without hearing back from anyone, we decided to go back to the hotel and was told that the room was ready. It would of been nice if they had called me as they told me they would\n\nUpon inspecting the room, we found a dirty fork and knife in the dishwasher, as well as trash in a trash can underneath the kitchen sink. When housekeeping called to see if the utensils were delivered, which I requested upon check-in and had been delivered, I told them about the trash and dirty utensils. They said they would send someone up to take care of it. No one ever showed up, so the trash and dirty utensils were left until the next day when housekeeping came to clean the room. The room did have a great view of the fountain, strip, and mountains!!!\n\nOn the evening of Thursday May 20th, I called concierge to attempt to change reservation time for dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse at Aria. I held on the phone for 30 mins waiting for someone to answer, but no one ever did, so I hung up and decided to call the restaurant directly myself. \n\nThe hotel is a nice hotel, which unlike some other reviewers, I feel that it IS within a short walk to the Bellagio, Aria, The Cosmopolitan, and the strip. I would suggest going to the 24hr CVS, which is a short walk and is located a block south of CityCenter on the strip to grab snacks and drinks, since the market inside the hotel has limited choices and closes at a certain time.\n\nThe Clark County fire station is located adjacent to the property. They tend to stay busy, which on one of the late nights/early morning hours, they seemed to respond to several calls in a span of 4 to 5 hours. The windows are not sound proof, so you will hear the sirens, which may interrupt your sleep if you're a light sleeper.\n\nThe entire property is nice, which I would stay there again, especially with it being a non-smoking/non-gaming hotel.",---,---,0,False

838,"Don't stay here!  Disgusting rooms for a lot of money!  My husband and I recently stayed here for his 35th birthday for one night.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge on the room (nearly $350 for a king, fountain view room - that's with the M Life discount).  We live in AZ and typically visit Vegas 4 times per year, so this was not our first time here.  \n\nOur first room was 16070.  Upon walking in, the room reeked of mildew.  It smelled like the carpet had been flooded for weeks and then dried off and put back to use.  We called the front desk and they moved us very quickly to a different room just down the hall (16048).  This room did not smell....or so we thought.  After being out and about and returning to our room after midnight, we just wanted a good night's rest.  We climbed into bed and realized that the sheets and bedding all reeked of mildew as well!!!  DISGUSTING!!!  Seeing as it was so late and we were exhausted, we did not want to call housekeeping and wait for them to strip our seats or have to pack up and move rooms once again.  So, we both slept uncomfortably fully clothed.  Isn't the purpose of a hotel to provide a comfortable night's stay?\n\nAlso, if you choose to stay in a fountain room, they do not tell you that you will hear the music from Drai's day and night club across the street at the Cromwell all day and all night long (until 4am).

846,"Quick review: Closer to 2.25 stars.  Tried the Friday night fish fry at Quivey's and wasn't terribly impressed.  Baked fish and perch were ok; deep fried cod was soggy, as were fries.  Service in the Stable Grill was quite lacking.  Averaged $20 per person with 1 drink.\n\n\nDetailed review:\nA few coworkers had been raving for months to us about Quivey's Grove - they insisted it was the \""""best fish fry you'll ever have.\""""  So, we rounded up the crew and hit Quivey's, hoping to score a stellar fish fry.\n\nWe placed our name for a table in the Stable Grill and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour, and that was with us arriving almost immediately at 5:00pm.  I can't imagine how long the wait would be later on at night!\n\nThe Stable Grill has a ton of character - it scores bonus points for the huge timber-frames and the awesome wooden bar.  Beer selections, while not countless, were really nicely represented - from Ale Asylum to Tyranena - nearly every one was a specialty Wisco microbrew.  Beers were $4 for a pint.\n\nWhile waiting, we ordered the cheese curds, which were served with a mustard side (interesting combo).  They were decent curds, but probably not worth $7.  As they sat, they became greasier - usually a sign of a fryer that's not up to a hot enough temperature.\n\nWe were led to our table at around 6:15, and were presented with menus.  As mentioned by others, the traditional menu at the Stable is geared toward sandwiches, many of which looked and sounded interesting, but we were here for the fish.\n\nFish options include: baked cod, deep fried cod, or deep fried lake perch.  Potato options are limited to parmesan potatoes or fries.  All come with coleslaw and a really nice bread - the bread was dense and flavorful, soft and chewy, with just a hint of crustiness.  You can order the deep fried cod with an all you can eat option for an extra $1.50.  \n\nI opted for the sampler, which got me a serving of each type of fish, and I chose fries as my side, because everyone else at the table went with the cheesy potatoes.  \n\nPlates arrived after a 20-30 minute wait.  The baked cod was mediocre - slightly watery, very mild in flavor, featured a firm and meaty texture, but wasn't terribly flaky.  My guess is that it had been sitting in a steam warmer for a while - it didn't taste \""""fresh from the oven.\""""\n\nThe deep fried lake perch was good.  Firm texture, good fish flavor, and featured a nice crumbly breading that stayed fairly crisp throughout the entire meal.  If I were to come back to Quivey's, I'd go with the perch.\n\nThe deep fried cod was a major let-down.  It was actually soggy when it arrived; the beer batter wasn't crisp, but instead spongey.  The fish itself was flavorless and extremely watery as well.  This fish had clearly been sitting for a long time before it was plated... argh.\n\nThe fries were as limp as any bad drive-thru fry I've ever had.  I ate about four of them and left the rest to sit.  I'm told the cheesy potatoes were ok, but some people's were cold as well.\n\nAfter polling the five members of my group, the general feeling was that Quivey's failed to deliver.  The fish was slightly below average, many items were cold, and everyone's deep fried cod was soggy and unappealing.  Service was slow and sparse as well.\n\nQuivey's Grove = FAIL\n\nFood = 2 stars\nService = 2 stars\nValue = 1.5 stars ($17 sampler plate; $14 for baked fish?)\nMISC = 3.5 stars (nice atmosphere, decent bar area)\n\nPerhaps we had a mediocre experience because it's lenten season and they were slammed?  I'd be hard-pressed to try the fish again, but I'd consider sampling some of the other food options.  Sorry Quivey - you've got a cool pad, but that's about all you've got going for you.","Quick review: Closer to 2.25 stars. Tried the Friday night fish fry at Quivey's and wasn't terribly impressed.

Averaged $20 per person with 1 drink.\n\n\nDetailed review:\nA few coworkers had been raving for months to us about Quivey's Grove - they insisted it was the \""""best fish fry you'll ever have.\"""" So, we rounded up the crew and hit Quivey's, hoping to score a stellar fish fry.\n\nWe placed our name for a table in the Stable Grill and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour, and that was with us arriving almost immediately at 5:00pm. I can't imagine how long the wait would be later on at night!\n\nThe Stable Grill has a ton of character - it scores bonus points for the huge timber-frames and the awesome wooden bar. Beer selections, while not countless, were really nicely represented - from Ale Asylum to Tyranena - nearly every one was a specialty Wisco microbrew. Beers were $4 for a pint.\n\nWhile waiting, we ordered the cheese curds, which were served with a mustard side (interesting combo). They were decent curds, but probably not worth $7. As they sat, they became greasier - usually a sign of a fryer that's not up to a hot enough temperature.\n\nWe were led to our table at around 6:15, and were presented with menus. As mentioned by others, the traditional menu at the Stable is geared toward sandwiches, many of which looked and sounded interesting, but we were here for the fish.\n\nFish options include: baked cod, deep fried cod, or deep fried lake perch. Potato options are limited to parmesan potatoes or fries. All come with coleslaw and a really nice bread - the bread was dense and flavorful, soft and chewy, with just a hint of crustiness. You can order the deep fried cod with an all you can eat option for an extra $1.50. \n\nI opted for the sampler, which got me a serving of each type of fish, and I chose fries as my side, because everyone else at the table went with the cheesy potatoes. \n\nPlates arrived after a 20-30 minute wait. The baked cod was mediocre - slightly watery, very mild in flavor, featured a firm and meaty texture, but wasn't terribly flaky. My guess is that it had been sitting in a steam warmer for a while - it didn't taste \""""fresh from the oven.\""""\n\nThe deep fried lake perch was good. Firm texture, good fish flavor, and featured a nice crumbly breading that stayed fairly crisp throughout the entire meal. If I were to come back to Quivey's, I'd go with the perch.\n\nThe deep fried cod was a major let-down. It was actually soggy when it arrived; the beer batter wasn't crisp, but instead spongey. The fish itself was flavorless and extremely watery as well. This fish had clearly been sitting for a long time before it was plated... argh.\n\nThe fries were as limp as any bad drive-thru fry I've ever had. I ate about four of them and left the rest to sit. I'm told the cheesy potatoes were ok, but some people's were cold as well.\n\nAfter polling the five members of my group, the general feeling was that Quivey's failed to deliver. The fish was slightly below average, many items were cold, and everyone's deep fried cod was soggy and unappealing. Service was slow and sparse as well.\n\nQuivey's Grove = FAIL\n\nFood = 2 stars\nService = 2 stars\nValue = 1.5 stars ($17 sampler plate; $14 for baked fish?)\nMISC = 3.5 stars (nice atmosphere, decent bar area)\n\nPerhaps we had a mediocre experience because it's lenten season and they were slammed? I'd be hard-pressed to try the fish again, but I'd consider sampling some of the other food options.

858,"After a long few nights of being out late, at least twice til the sun came up, it was nice to finally find the time to sit down for a nice, relaxing breakfast.  With my cousin just having arrived in town, this was the perfect place for us to hang out and catch up.  My cousin is at least 20 or so years older than me.  This was the first time that we'd sat down to a meal together, just the cousins and not our parents. So, this was fun.  It was even nicer that the waitstaff were so friendly and so quick to accommodate our every need.  The food was tasty and fresh.  I didn't have to wait in any long lines.  So, that either tells me that I was late to the buffet or that this buffet is just one of the ones that is not so popular amongst those who are in Vegas mid week. Whatever the reason, there were no long lines. My omelette was made to perfection.

That should tell you something when the place used to be exceptionally busy.  First, unfriendly wait staff  should be replaced with eager enthusiastic servers. The wedding soup was the best tasting item on the menu.\nThe vegetable boat is something that is reminescent of an antipasta tray. It could use some sprucing up. The clam dip was ho hum and terribly runny. \nWe wanted veal but they were \""""out\"""" of it. Really? This is a city and you are a pricey restaurant with diners expecting a certain level of service on a saturday  evening. How can you not have access to veal. We were there at 6 pm and I saw no dinner rush so that would not explain it. So, we ordered Chicken and to say the least it was dissappointing. Desserts are glorified Costco cakes ( the chocolate one was a wad of Ganache). Truly this place is overpriced and obviously not on the radar of the foodie scene in Pittsburgh. My guess is that they have a few\nLine cooks back in the kitchen. Its sad because the intimate atmosphere could really be improved upon and the restaurant be very exclusive with a top notch chef.

Yes, you totally wouldn't expect a joint such as this at a gas station to serve such good food like Chile Verde does, but you are in for a surprise. Plus, you can't really see their signage since it's on the same one as the gas station prices, but I guess they get all their business through word of mouth and of course Yelp. Our church group uses this gas station for our fireworks booth and 2 years ago when we first did it I didn't really pay much attention to them. Now that I read all these awesome reviews I definitely had to try them out. During our 6 days we were there I tried them 2 times and they certainly did not disappoint! The first time I had the nachos with beef and everyone is right the tortilla chips are made fresh and they are delicious. Unlike, Roberto's who has dry nachos and carne asada, their version of beef nachos was certainly not dry but had some moisture to them. I'm glad I asked for my beans on the side because it would of ruined the awesome texture of the fresh tortilla chips. The second time I ordered the California burrito, which was priced at around $5. This burrito was huge! At other places they would probably price it at $6 or $7 which makes Chile Verde affordable. I bet 2 people with smaller appetites could share that burrito because I could only eat 3/4 and let me tell you I am an eater. The inside of the burrito had fries and beef with salsa. Pretty delicious I must say. My only major gripe is that the owner is a 1 man show! He is the cashier, the cook, the expediter, everything! I know he is probably doing that to reduce costs and keep prices low, but man the wait time is rather long just like everyone says. Both times I was there, he was super busy.
