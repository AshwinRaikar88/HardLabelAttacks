"L.A. people are so spoiled with wonderful sushi restaurants at nearly every corner - I'm one of those people. But I have to say that Roka Akor has blown most of the L.A. sushi restaurants I've been to out of the water. I don't always rate the restaurants I eat at for various reasons, but I couldn't wait to rate this restaurant. You'll see why...read on please.\n\nRoka Akor is rated as one of the Top 10 sushi restaurants in the U.S. by Bon Appetit, so with that rating plus being from L.A., we were definitely expecting a lot. We were welcomed warmly, seated promptly at the best seat at the sushi bar, and given our menus. We took a gander, and were kind of shocked at the minimal selection of rolls on their menu. (Of course this didn't matter later once we tasted their food - everything is excellent. Don't let this disappoint you, it's excellent food.) A few minutes later, I noticed another couple seated a few seats away from us. Their waitress attended to them right away, and we still hadn't been attended to at that point, so I was immediately pissed off and ready to walk out of the restaurant. My friends who know me well, know that this action would have been true to form. I'm nice, but I'm accustomed to excellent service at all types of establishments. When I don't get it, I get pissed off - that's just who I am and I don't think I'm the only one.\n\nI digress...\n\nI'm glad my husband kept me seated to give the waiter a chance to come over and take our order because I ended up really enjoying myself...and the food obviously. We had a sampler of Shochu drinks, which are these delicious infused drinks. Our favorite was the Fuji Apple flavor, although all of them were good. At the same time we were served our appetizer - the Butterfish Tataki with white asparagus yuzu. (Incidentally, the Fuji Apple Shochu really brought out the flavors of the Butterfish Tataki.) Usually butterfish has a muddled flavor - I think that's just the nature of that fish, but their preparation of this fish really cleaned it up. It exploded with flavor - very delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the Hamachi Serrano Chili Maki. This roll has very clean flavors - I enjoyed it very much. Next came the Roka Sushi selection, which are 4 different types of sushi selected by the chef. My only qualm here is that one of the four nigiri given was something we also had a full order of (the Salmon Goma Nigiri). Nonetheless, all of it was good. After that came the full order of Salmon Goma nigiri we ordered, which was sooooooo SO good. My husband usually doesn't like salmon because he thinks it's too fishy, while I ordinarily love salmon. We both loved loved loved this. It was so excellent. I would definitely order it again. Finally, we received the kobe beef, which was also very good. Perfectly cooked medium rare and lots of flavor. It comes with mushrooms which added a great dynamic flavor to the meat, and this yummy creamy sauce in which to dip the meat. Delicious. For dessert, we had the Green Tea Custard. We ordered this mostly out of curiosity. Who's ever heard of a Green Tea flavored custard? It did not disappoint. Light & airy, this custard really impressed us. I only wish I had the black cod because it looked so yummy and other yelpers have raved about it, but oh well. Maybe next time.\n\nAfter the meal, our server apologized for the delay we experienced earlier in the evening. I really appreciated and respected that. It was definitely a good move on his part, and he got a good tip out of it. Later, though, I thought that if they were really sorry they could have comp'd part of our meal.

The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.\n\nAlthough the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us.

We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen. \n\nOur food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought;\n- The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance).\n- The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though.\n- The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh.\n- The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it.\n- I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being. \n- The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.\n\nI don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.\n\nI was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies. \n\nSo all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung.",N/A,1,2,Skipped,0

It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.\n\nTo say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the \""""Please Seat Yourself\"""" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.\n\nI only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.\n\nWhen Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to \""""start from the left, and work your way to the right\"""" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.\n\nWe picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. \n\nAt first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!\n\nScott recommended the \""""Pulled Pork Sliders\"""". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).\n\nAs the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.\n\nCue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) \n\nWe sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. \n\nBy the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! \n\nAs we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  \n\nAnd did I mention the \""""Library\""""? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!\n\nThat wraps it up for my 50th review.

"I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.\n\nFood 4 stars\nThey just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better. \nThe kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.  \n\nService 3 stars\nWhile I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People, this place has a beer selection!  Again, the bartender has always been ok, but an extra wow factor can make a difference. \n\nLocation/Atmosphere 3.5 stars\nThis used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much.

"I've been riding on Mallard/Clarks Creek Greenway for several months now. I'm new to cycling and figured that this would be a good learning point before dealing with traffic on the open road. Plus it's one of the only Greenways in this area that is longer than 2 miles one way. \nThe paved section is around 10miles (out and back) so you can get a decent \""""newbie\"""" ride. I like and don't like how it winds behind housing developments. It's nice to see what the Jones' are up to but also kind of creepy thinking that you may be watched. The route is a good workout with some small, slight climbs and turns. Parts of it is uphill a little bit (mostly heading back from Saxonbury way). There is a lot of activity during the warmer days. Plenty of dog walkers and other fellow bikers. \nParking at the Elementary School can be limited, especially if going around 2 o'clock and the uphill climb is brutal when you are returning to your car. There is also parking along Saxonbury way which is very accessible and if you're eager for more, then you can ride throughout the neighborhood too. \nThe trail is decently maintained but I think that may have to do with the budget cuts in Charlotte. You will definitely find better maintained Greenways in the counties north of Charlotte (i.e. Davidson and Cabarrus). The main issue with this is dodging sticks and debris after a storm the night before and also navigating across the bridges. I'm afraid of losing a tire over some of them with their gnarly, knotty wood. It would be nice if they had water fountains and Doggie Depots along the greenway but I may just be spoiled from Cabarrus County. \nYou can easily make this a 12miler by adding the University Research trail and the Kirk Farm Fields trail. I will say that if you have a Road bike then it may be an uncomfortable and unstable ride through the research park as it's loose gravel/rock.

"I booked a room at the 69th St, Scottsdale, AZ location for the 26th & 27th of November. My wife's parents are in a nursing home a few miles from there and we wanted to make and take them a homemade Thanksgiving dinner. I choose this property due to proximity and the advertised kitchen with full sized refrigerator. I even called ahead to request a ground floor room and confirm a full sized refrigerator and was assured that was what I was going to get. Upon check in the person behind the counter told us we were on the 2nd floor. I explained that we requested and confirmed a ground room floor. His response was that no we had a 2nd room floor. When we got to the room we noticed a very small dorm room sized fridge and a very small microwave. I talked with the front desk about this problem but they offered no solution. Because of the effort we used to haul all of our stuff up to the room we decided to utilize an ice chest we brought for the lack of refrigerator space and try to make best with what we were given. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work and the odors escaping into the kitchen forced us to go and buy some spray. Once we started to cook the meal I noticed that the front burner on the stove did not work. Because of the time urgency I was forced to remove, clean and adjust the burner to make it work. After the water started boiling I noticed a brownish colored liquid that was dripping from the hood. I looked underneath and found that it looked like it had never been cleaned and we were getting a mix of condensation and old grease from previous visitors. In the middle of the night the toilet stopped flushing and then, due to the paper thin walls, the neighbors kept us awake til 2 am.

"I will never set foot in this store ever again after today.  About three weeks ago I brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.  Upon inspection from the guys, the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain, so they suggested to replace those too.  I figured why not, might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part, which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left, I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday, and if not I'd have it early next week.\n\nGreat!  I'm all excited, it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days, but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes, didn't get my bike on Friday, (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday, or Wednesday.  So on Thursday, I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold, late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work, I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \n\nYesterday, I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night, the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though, so I was very confused.  This morning, I'm on my way to work, just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.

I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way, I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\n\nLike I said at the top, I'll never go back...",Failed to initialize,0,,False,946

The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor.

"The infamy that arose from this race has been pretty widespread by now. But here's my take on how the race went.\n\nThe way they formatted this marathon was pretty horrid. They started the full runners at 4pm and started the half runners at 5:30pm. They divided people up by corrals per your estimated completion time. I thought I'd finish the full in 4:20, so they put me in Corral 8 for the full. For the Halfers, since there were 38,000 signed up, they had up to 41 waves.\n\nBy the time I made it to the 2nd half, they had just let the final corral go, so I automatically ran into the walkers. The final corral consists of the slowest people, naturally. Runner's etiquette is that if you're slow, you hang to the right. None of these people knew of this apparently. Also, there was a 6 foot wide area for full marathoners to run [since we'd be going at a faster speed than the half marathoners at that point] while the rest of the Strip was dedicated to the Halfers. Halfers did not adhere to these boundaries and a whole bunch of walkers and slow runners made their way to the full marathon area.\n\nAnother annoyance is that water support was on the left curb of the Strip, to the left of the full marathon lane. Therefore, if half marathoners needed water, they stampeded through the full marathoners' lane.\n\nSo yeah, I played human Frogger from mile 14 to mile 22. 8 miles of bobbing and weaving after already having run 13 miles was not exactly ideal. That being said, it was a great experience and I had a great run. I think, personally, I did my best, but I could have done better. I am very happy with my time and am looking forward to March, the next time I run a marathon.\n\nWhat's ridiculously crazy is that there were about 37,000 people that finished the race [out of 44,000 that signed up], add friends and family.. there were that many people stacked up at the Mandalay Bay. That, combined with the debut weekend showing of the Michael Jackson 'Immortal' show letting out at the same time that the marathoners were wrapping up their run, it was absolute chaos. The shut down the Strip until 10pm, so there was crazy traffic there. Then there was a shortage of cabs. The water they were supplying during the race was hydrant water. They used trashcans to store the water and hoses to distribute the water, so people were getting sick left and right. Someone posted on the Facebook wall an MSNBC article pointing out the top 10 worst cities to drink their water. Las Vegas was #3, lol.\n\nPeople were puking and passing out left and right, fights were breaking out over the cabs, it was pretty crazy. People on the Facebook wall were saying that there are hundreds of suits waiting to happen.\n\nI think this race is best kept as a half marathon and will likely return next year to run the halfie, since the halfie experience was not nearly as bad as the full-marathoners' experience.",Failed to initialize,0,,False,964

"I ended up scavenging for lunch a little later than usual today, and wanted something light, and that's when I saw the new yogurt place on Mill Ave offered smoothies. While the outside still looks temporary, I assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness. And yumminess.\n\nIt didn't take long before an employee asked me if I had been there before, and explained to me how it works. The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly). \n\nIt looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo. Since I was on a smoothie mission though, I didn't take a great while to look at those in detail. I did notice on top of the toppings bar though, a sign that said they always have bananas and will slice one up for you upon request. BONUS!! BANANA BONUS!!\n\nI loved the smoothie options available, as they weren't all filled with strawberries and other things I am not a fan of. Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand.

I also noticed they have a club card that is free where you accumulate points per purchase. One downfall is that there isn't much seating - probably about 10 or so high bar type chairs along the back wall, but I've never seen too many people ever sit and eat in one of these joints, so it may not be a complete deal breaker.\n\nIt's a small but very cute and super friendly place and I really enjoyed the smoothie.

Their yucca fries are heavenly, and so are their fried plantains. The wood-fire chicken is so smokey and tender, the pork was nice and juicy, the avocado sauce is perfectly creamy, ugh. So good. They give you two sauces; one's a spicier one and the other is a creamy cilantro I believe. I like to mix them and drown my arepas in them. \n\nIf you decide to go here, which I highly recommend and will be extremely envious about, be ready to waddle out the door. If you're anything like me, it'll be nearly impossible to choose one arepa to try and you'll end up getting 2 and an empanada (which is also delicious) and yucca fries.

We paid $320 to play both courses on the same day.  Here are my thoughts.\n\nEither courses lacked any real feature.  They were flat and boring.  No elevation changes, no scenic desert scape and the holes were generally boring in design.  Just a flat course in the middle of the desert.  There are plenty of better courses in Phoenix that are cheaper and way more entertaining and challenging for much lower price (500 club, ASU Karsten, Papago, Dove Valley, etc...).  If you want to pay this kind of price and enjoy the scenery as well as challenge, try TPC Scottsdale, Ocotillo, Raven, Triology, Troon North for starter).  I'm not opposed to high green fees just as long as they provide value.\n\nOn the day of the course, the greens were rock hard and didn't hold a single ball - not even a nine iron on to the front of the green.  When we got done, none of us walked away with 'oh, what about that hole' with any enthusiasm.  For the price we paid, this was not much better than a muni track.

Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.\n\nDon't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance.

"I felt like I had walked into the first level of hell when I walked through the double glass doors into the Cox Digital Store to return my cable boxes. When I walked in (carrying no less than THREE boxes, with THREE remotes perched precariously on top and wires dangling down past my ankles), there were three ladies sitting behind desks. Two had customers, one was filing her nails. There were four people ahead of me. One lady looked up and barked at me to take a seat and grab a number (very DMV-esque). Looking around for a place to set down my heavy burden, no seats were available. One guy (a true gentleman) jumped up, grabbed the boxes from me, chivalrously gave me his seat, and then snagged an extra chair from the desk of the lady who was filing her nails (she didn't even look up). After sitting for about 5 minutes, one of the customers currently being helped finished up and left. The lady helping him got up from her desk and went to the back. The other lady with no customers also got up and began boxing up cable boxes (mind you, STILL five people waiting). The third lady finished with her customer, and (thankfully) called the next number. That customer must have had a doozie of a cable issue, because when lady number two came back to her desk, and was about to call the next number, lady number one called her over to the desk to help sort out her customer's problem. Lady #3 went to the back. Meanwhile, more customers began trickling in. FINALLY, they managed to get through the line of customers ahead of me, and it was my turn (30 minutes later). I walked up with my cable boxes (none of which she offered to help me with), and when I told her I needed to return them because my service had been canceled, she just looked at me and said \""""you know you could have just mailed those in, right?\"""".

"My friends and I stayed at the Trump International Hotel from 4/29/11 to 5/1/11. We had a bad experience from the moment we arrived.  The valet who unloaded our car opened the back of the van hastily and several of our bags fell out, he picked the bags up without apologizing placed them on the bellhop cart and as he pushed them away our bags fell off the cart again.  When we walked into the Lobby we were extremely impressed, it was gorgeous!  They pump in floral scents and there are chandeliers and gold everywhere.  But, that was where it ended for us.  The hotel claimed to not have our reservation even though there was a hold placed on my friends credit card.  When they found our reservation they said they would not be able to place us in adjoining suites.  When we argued with the girl she suddenly found two suites for us.  We entered the suites and began looking around.  At first sight the suite was beautiful, then we noticed a weird hissing sound coming from the windows, when we asked the bellhop about it he explained that sometimes the window system that allows fresh air in will break and we might be unable to close it, but he suggested we call the maintenance staff and they would bring us some duct tape to tape over the vent.  Really?  The TV in the living room area did not work and we had to call maintenance to come and fix the TV.  The TV in the bathroom did not work either.  The beds were made, but the carpet was filthy, and there was dirt on the sofas.  There were no extra towels (one bath towel and one hand towel per bathroom in both suites), no extra toilet paper or tissue, and one pillow per pullout sofa.  As we were unpacking one of the housekeeping workers came to the room to apologize for the room being unfinished, she complained to us that it was because \""""they called me and told me to stop cleaning\"""".  I found it unprofessional she would complain to us.  The man who came to clean the carpet (yes, it was bad enough they had to shampoo the carpet) apologized for the room and said it was unacceptable that we were given a room like that.  When one friend who did not drive with us arrived, the valet lost her key.  She handed it to him, he somehow dropped it and he approached her as she checked in and accused her of not giving him the key.  When she was unable to find it in her purse they told her that because SHE lost the key they would need to tow her car at her expense.  They called her a few minutes later in the room to tell us that they found her key on the ground under her car.  Again, no apology for being rude.  The only staff we had contact with that were friendly were the room service staff.  Although we did find it odd that they never once rang the doorbell, they just entered the room.  The good things about the hotel were the lobby, the roomservice (reasonable prices and delicious food), and the free shuttle service.

"I went to this restaurant because my Dad and stepmom had previously dined there a few years ago and said it was really good.  Well, either I hit this place on an off night or the food quality has done downhill over the last few years.  I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and the chicken parmigiana.  It came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette that was pretty tasteless.  The chicken parmigiana was just okay.  Nothing standout, and dare I say, Olive Garden has a better chicken parmigiana.  The entree came with a side of ziti that was decent, but nothing special.  I was shocked when the bill came...$34 before tip.  The wine was $8 so the chicken parm cost $26?  Never again.  The food is drastically over-priced for the quality you get.

"YOUR GUIDE TO A SUCCESSFUL FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.  We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single complaint and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A ROOM:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the upgrade for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a cluster mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.

"While in Vegas for a conference last week, my company treated us to dinner at SW Steakhouse and while the steaks were fantastic, the rest of the meal left us lacking.\n\nThe waiting area is extremely small and there are only about 6 stools in the bar, so large-ish groups like ours (5 at the time, 7 in total), can find themselves standing around for quite a bit.\n\nOnce seated, the service was extremely slow as we sat, ready to order but unattended to for at least fifteen minutes.  The wine that was recommended to us, although okay, was nothing special and, they only had two bottles, meaning we had to switch mid-way thorough the meal.  Every quality steakhouse I've ever been to has always notified us of a low inventory BEFORE serving the wine, especially when we've had a group of 5-7 people.  Not a major issue with SW but it just shows a lack of finesse, especially when paying a minimum of $54 for an a la carte steak.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nAs I mentioned, the steaks are FANTASTIC.  The veal chop that was ordered by a fellow diner also received rave reviews.  I had the smallest steak offered, a 9oz filet, cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Another diner had the same steak only cooked medium well and his only (small issue) was that had specifically requested it be cooked with a thin line of pink and there was no pink at all.  But, he had zero complaints on the flavor or the texture - it was buttery and juicy and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rib-eyes were ordered by the rest of the table and all greatly enjoyed their steaks.\n\nAs with most (all?) high-end steakhouses, all sides are ordered a la carte.  At SW, the sides are $12 each with the sauteed wild mushrooms and grilled asparagus being the exception as they are $16 each.  All the sides are large enough to share but the potatoes gratin is quite small and unless everyone takes a very small portion, it would only serve 3.  And although the rest of the sides we ordered - creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms and black truffle creamed corn - were more than enough to serve all 7 of us, I have to wonder if that was due to the poor quality of the sides. No one went back for seconds on anything except the mushrooms. I can say that I highly recommend them,\n\nThe potatoes gratin came out lukewarm with the cheesy crust already solidified.  The potatoes were undercooked and we had to use a knife to remove the servings as the spoon was unable to cut through the hard potatoes.\n\nThe creamed spinach was not creamy. At all. It was all water without any of the normal creamy goodness that you expect to be clinging to the spinach.  It was swimming in water when it came to the table and once spooned on the plate, the water went everywhere, affecting all the servings on the plate.\n\nThe black truffle creamed corn was just weird. The black truffle, of which I am normally a HUGE fan, was just misplaced here.  It was almost like an afterthought and simply added to attempt to validate $12 for a $3 dish.  The corn itself was just mush. There were no kernels of plump, sweet corn and in mid-summer, the height of corn season, that's just sacrilege. \n\nThe grilled asparagus were thick and perfectly grilled and perhaps with a seafood dish they would have been more well received.  Or in hindsight, squeezing some fresh lemon on them would have probably made a world of difference.  Their charred smokey flavor too closely resembled that of the steaks and therefore they didn't have any real oomph of their own.  A drizzle of  Hollandaise would have also given them their own identity. \n\nAll in all, I would not go back here again unless invited (and paid for) by someone else.  Cut by Wolfgang Puck will be my next LV steakhouse adventure.  If invited back to SW again, I would at least make sure that we had a table with a view of the Lake of Dreams show. The little peeks that we were able to catch from the corner of our table were very impressive.",N/A,1,2,Skipped,0
"\u00e9 by Jose Andres\nFebruary 8, 2012 - 8:30PM\n\nGeneral Fine-Dining Disclaimer: Many people do not understand that most (if not all) upscale restaurants do not pile a ton of food on your plate. A diner should appreciate the finest flavors orchestrated into smaller dishes, which is how we received our servings. If you're looking for places that serve up large piles of food and multiple napkins, kindly skip my reviews. \n\nEater.com says that this hidden restaurant is one of the hardest reservations to get. All we did to get them was email the website *exactly* one month in advance and wait. In fact, we waited a week without word but were able to secure a reservation for the requested night. They also explained that they are very busy (as you can imagine) and they are almost always booked solid.\n\nOnce you secure your reservations, you'll get a pair of Golden tickets (just like Willy Wonka) by mail. If you live farther than the East Coast, you probably won't get it in time for the event. But they'll still let you in.\n\nOn the night of dinner, get there at least 15 minutes in advance. Have one of Jose's signature Ultimate Gin and Tonics because it really is the ultimate.\n\nTip: Ask the head chef for permission to take pictures as a courtesy. You will be allowed to but you cannot take video (a shame) or use a flash (also a shame, because it's dim in there). When they begin their choreographed assembly of each disk (and I wonder how often they practice), you'll see that flash photography would interfere with their procedures.\n\nEight seats.

How do you keep track of each dish *and* take pictures of each? Not easy.\n\nEach dish is composed with fine detail and precision, and Chef Brett took time to describe each (after they were handed to each guest). He also answered any/all questions from the guests while we ate.\n\nOur favorite dishes were:\n\nFried Bone Marrow - Possibly the greatest flavor I've ever experienced. The GF lost her mind over this also.\n\nFried Chicken Skin w/ Oysters and Caviar - If you love chicken skin,  this will rock your world.

"My partner and I just left and were disgusted by our experience. It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread. \n\nAfter being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation. \n\nIn seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise.

"NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\"""" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)

"I FLAT REFUSE TO STEP FOOT IN WinCo Foods for as long as I am residing in Las Vegas. I went in today and trouble began from the second I pulled into the lot. The parking spaces on the North side had broken glass all over the place and with traffic behind me I had to drive through it. Not cool. Then after getting a space I can't even get to the door because the hordes of people are gawking at a Henderson PD Parking Enforcement officer who was circling like a vulture waiting to write tickets. Once inside I had a foot run over by a shopping cart and in the bulk foods section I had 2 different people ram me in the derriere with a cart in under 90 seconds. Hello? I'm 6'4 and wearing a red shirt. It's not like they couldn't see me! I know I'm not a small guy. But I'm trying to lose weight so having a steel shopping cart attached to my rear is not going to help me any. \n\nSo after extracting myself from the shopping carts of mayhem I head over to the deli counter. I ask them a simple question about the source of their meats and I get the classic I don't have a clue shrug. Ugh! After fighting the madhouse to get through the rest of the store for what I need I finally get up to the front to check out. I have 16 items...I thought it was 15, my bad. Self check out is for 15 items..it's posted on the overhead sign. I get in line and next thing I know I have some woman counting my items and saying I have 1 too many. Fine, I take an item out of the cart and set it to the side and she's like sorry, you have to go to another line. I tell her I now have 15 items, she's like you need to go to another line. At that point I'm at thermonuclear launch mode (this is ultra rare for me) and I'm like this is ridiculous. I raise my voice and tell her and a lot of others in earshot: Let me tell you how I'm going to save at WinCo...I'm leaving, and I WON'T BE BACK! On my way out the door a couple that saw what happened said good for me, that I did the right thing. Not that I needed the validation but still...enough is enough. \n\nMaybe when someone carves a replica of the Taj Mahal in ice in Hell, Michigan will I ever step foot in that store again. 1 star, and a bump to the EEK!

"Our first visit to Remington's was on a recent weeknight.  We made reservations but they certainly were not needed as the dining room was nearly empty.  By contrast the bar lounge area was rather busy.  A piano and lounge singer could be heard into the dining room, kind of a nice background that we did enjoy.  Others have raved about this being a classy place.  I sure didn't get that vibe.  It was more 80's dated hotel restaurant than classy to me.\n\nWe had a very attentive waiter who served us well.  There seemed to be a lot of servers with a lot of busy acitivty, constantly in and out of swinging doors.  There was a large group in a private closed off dining area.  We noticed most patrons were in their Senior years.  Maybe they alternate between here and Charleston's?\n\nBetween us we ordered steak & grilled salmon with a potato dish to share and a couple of side salads.  The steak was not cooked as requested but we didn't bother to send it back.  Salmon was unremarkable.  The tomato mozzarella salad was abundant but yellow tomatoes were inedible mush and the red tomatoes were just flavorless.  Lyonnaise potatoes were a tad greasy.  Dinners are all ala carte.  Nothing was particularly bad, just nothing to get excited about.  I felt like I was dining in a hotel restaurant, food was delivered with plastic covers like they use in room service dining.  \n\nOverall I have to say I was simply underwhelmed.  After reading other reviews I had greater expectations for Remington's.  At a total of $84 (no alcohol) we expected more.  If I were a hotel guest on an expense account, maybe I would have felt differently. For the money, next time I would drive just down the street and go to Ruth's Chris.

I am a film geek all the way, and when I go to see something on a big screen I am seriously going to see a 'film' that is art presented as it is intended to be seen...large.  I do not go to a cinema for the social aspect, or to kill time with a date, or to just get out for an evening, with what's showing on the screen being secondary to the purpose of the evening.  \n\nWhen I go to see a film, I do NOT go to listen to the conversations of others, the bleeping of the cell phones, the clicking of mindless text messaging or silly giggling that comes from someone's interaction that has nothing to do with what's on the screen.\n\nThis is where the Regent Square Theater wins.  This is a cinema for serious film lovers. You may not find a HUGE audience, but what you will find is an audience of people who know how to behave in a cinema, who are there for the same purpose...to see a good film on a big screen.  The audience at the Regent Square theater know directors, and they might actually be able to hold a conversation about the director, his or her films, other similar films and directors, and they know to wait to do it when the film has ended.  \n\nThe Regent Square is a very comfortable old-style small theater.  One screen. Small reasonably friendly staff, affordable prices (although the last night I went the popcorn, which was cheap, was also a tad stale) and most importantly...a venue for excellent films.  Foreign, indie, documentary...and some classics thrown in regularly to enable us to see some of those old gems on a big screen, where most of them were meant to be.

One who doesn't watch these things on a big screen doesn't know what they're missing by not seeing the full large scope of the intended art.  \n\nSome (in this era, I can't claim 'many') directors truly do use the big screen when creating their art. Jeunet, Almodovar, and a few others still do present film as art, and the Regent Square (and Pittsburgh Filmmakers who operates it) bring these gems to that big screen.\n\nAnd to a film aficionado, the right atmosphere is crucial when getting lost in this art. The Regent Square Theater knows this, and so do its audiences.\n\nThank you for providing an intellectual oasis in da burgh...and a great evening of cinema enjoyment.",Failed to initialize,1,,False,943

"Went to Vegas for my birthday weekend planning to have a nice trip with family and friends. Everything was great up until this buffet. We went on Saturday for some breakfast which was okay. That experience gets four stars for great service and decent tasting breakfast foods. Today, Sunday, was an ebtirely different story. Wanted to top the weekend off with an awesome Luau themed buffet recommended by the awesome staff from yesterday only to be majorly disappointed. Excited, we waited in a two and a half hour line which was totally no big based on Saturday's great service and the awesome Hawaiian dishes we were about to experience. Then we get to the cashier who cashes out the first half of our party of five but snubs the second half without a basic \""""one moment please\"""" just turns around and processes someone else through (she knew we were a part of the same party, no excuses for a bad attitude and crap customer service). Hostess who sat us was wonderful all smiles. The second host who sat us was less than accompdating. As she was setting silverware I attempted to ask her about the champagne service for brunch because we were craving a couple of mimosas and knew the service would end soon. She blatantly ignored me to scurry off somewhere else. My friend caught her again after a few minutes and she merely told us the sever we had been waiting for to take our drinks would be right with us before scurrying away without waiting for a response. Which she probably knew would have been that our waiter hadn't come by our table in the twenty minutes we had been sitting there. Finally we catch a hold of a random guy serving a nearby table, Steve, and he's great totally takes our orders and even though its his first day he's doing a splendid job. Unfortunately, we are unable to get our mimosas because they stopped serving the champagne after 3:30. Twenty minutes after we were sat and ten minutes after we finally found a waiter to take our drink order. Normally, the sucky service would have just been shrugged off. But being told we didn't make it for the champagne when we did and had waited in a two and a half hour line partly for that service. Was going to leave only one star but Steve's awesomeness gets its own star. Conclusion: pretty good food but sh*t customer service on Sunday brunch days. Don't wait in line expecting the food to make up for bad customer service. Not worth the $20 to get in or the $13 with the players card.

"I was in town this past weekend with my son and four of his groomsman for his bachelor party.  We needed a steak and found this place here on Yelp.  After the mostly very positive reviews, we decided to go.  \n\nCircus Circus.  What can I say.  Wayyyy past its prime.  But nicely hidden, so much so that if you're not really looking you will miss it, is The Steakhouse.  What a nice surprise.  \n\nThis is a throwback to the old school style steakhouse which my son and I totally love.  Dark wood, cozy surroundings etc.  I was looking for the Rat Pack. (Frank, Dino, Sammy)  You walk right past the grill area when you are seated and we had a table where we could watch the guys cooking the steaks.  Kind of neat.   Just a great atmosphere for eating a steak dinner with friends.\n\nWe were greeted by our waiter, Ray, promptly.  I mentioned the bachelor party thing and he immediately lit up and was engaged in making our time a good one.  He is a veteran of the game and knew just how to take care of us.  Drinks and food were ordered and away we went.\n\nWhere they stumbled was with the food.  Drinks were great, salads were very good.  But 3 of us had ordered steak medium rare and received medium well.  Also, I ordered a lobster tail with my ribeye and the tail was raw on the inside.  BUT our man Ray handled the situation professionally which is to say with no comment other than a sincere apology and the offer to redo the meals which we accepted.  Unfortunately, a few minute later, a runner came out with my lobster tail which had clearly been nuked in the microwave.  All shriveled up and steaming.  Ray was nearby and I flagged him down and he was aghast.  The ruined tail was taken away no questions asked.  We a were offered a round of free cocktails while we waited and it was a bachelor party so....Way to go Ray.\n\nUnfortunately our 3 friends were done with their meals when our redone meals arrived.  But they arrived completely fresh and perfectly done.   No recycled veggies etc.  In the end we all had terrific meals and were completely satisfied.\n\nBut again, the fantastic Ray then offers unsolicited our choice of free dessert or an after dinner drink of our choice.  Again, being it was a bachelor party....We all had generous shots of a nice high end bourbon for \""""dessert.\""""\n\nSo even though there were a few hiccups, the staff handled them very well and we were completely satisfied.  And at a price that was about half of what we would have paid at one of the more notable places like Gordon Ramsey's at the Paris. A great time was had by all.\n\nThanks Ray.",Failed to initialize,1,,False,944

"For reference i went to this place Wednesday june 30th at 11pm. Where should i start with this place? First, extremely pricey and 1 drink per person minimum. Three drinks and one hookah is $42.00. second, right away service wad horrible, drinks took 20 minutes to reach our table and that is after checking on them twice just to find out the kid who was making the drinks just left them in the blender and walked upstairs to chat up two girls that I guess he was more interested in than helping paying customers. ( mind you this was at 11pm on Wednesday with only one other couple there at the time so it's not like the  kid was busy).  So that being said the hookah actually took even LONGER than the drinks about 35 mins to be exact. And after delivering the hookah it became very harsh within 4 mins of sampling it. When we went to go ask the kid at the front to fix it we found him smoking what seemed to be (and smelled like marijuana) upstairs with his little gfs. We at this point were so upset that he was not helping us at all that we demanded a refund in which he said he couldn't even give us even though we did not even touch the hookah. The kids name is Blake. Or at least that's the name he gave us lol. But I would never recommend this place and would honestly love to give it negative stars If possible.

"Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. \n\nLocated in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. \n\nRanging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. \n\nWithin minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.\n\nThe next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.\n\nOn a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. \n\nA new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. \n\nDim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.\n\nWhile I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.",N/A,1,2,Skipped,0

The tortilla soup was hearty and had a pleasant flavor. The tortilla strips and melted queso fresco inside added a nice touch. The shredded beef was marinated in interesting flavors (something beer/alcohol-based I believe) and made for a good light taco meal. The prices were fair, with entrees coming in around $10 and individual tacos at $2 each. The soup was very good, but at $6, it feels a little overpriced.

"Although this little spot is only a half mile from my work, I had never noticed it until Groupon ran a special recently.  So glad I found it!\n\nSince we had a groupon, we decided to order a few extra things to sample the menu.  We started with the chicken salad.  It was SO good.  Not too much dressing/mayo, and a nice fragrant hint of rosemary with sliced grapes.  It would have only been improved by having a huge hunk of bread on the side.  We shared a bowl of the cheddar bacon potato soup.  It was pretty tasty, but nearly caused 3rd degree burns - it was waaayyyy too hot!  We wished that it had been a little chunkier, and seemed like it would've worked even better as a cheese fondue dip!  Next up was the peppercorn burger, ordered with the addition of bacon and white cheddar, based on the advice of our server, Nicole.  She was an absolute rockstar - she had lots of suggestions and was a great help navigating the menu.  Her advice was spot on - the peppercorn burger was amazing!  Also on her advice, I sampled the Morning After drink (pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and champagne).  It was spectacular and very, very strong.

I was pretty disappointed on this visit. The food was great but the service sucked. We had to wait a while and the server did not really interact with us. I ordered an appetizer that never arrived and the server acted like he did not even know I ordered it. Maybe he should write down what his customers ordered instead of relying on his memory. It seemed like he was there to just do his eight hours and then get out of there. After we finished our meal he took the plates but the rest of the table was still a bit messy. We ordered dessert but we had to clean the table ourselves just to make sure it was clear.I don't expect an immaculate table but at least make an attempt to make sure the table will be ready for when my dessert arrives.

If it is your first time there the servers warn you not to expect large portions and suggest you order several plates if you want more of a variety. With this in mind I ordered the shrimp risotto and the salmon. The risotto came with jumbo shrimp and was a little more al dente in some parts than I would have cared for but was still good.

The combination of the salmon and the mushrooms makes this plate a must try. I was sufficiently satisfied after both of these plates. My dining companion ordered the half roasted chicken. Unfortunately, the plate lacked the wow factor the salmon had, and the chicken lacked any flavor on its own, and the broccolini it came with was way overcooked and inedible. We ended up having to add salt to give the chicken any flavor. The manager also surprised us with a mini cheesecake for my birthday (yay!), which I thought was nice. To top off the meal I had a Smith & Forge hard cider (yum!) and my companion had some drink (can't remember the name) that had raspberries in it. Unfortunately, the bartender who made it forgot to strain the seeds out, making it impossible to drink, and it had to be sent back.

"Mirage Nail & Spa was suggested to me over 2 years ago and I have been going back ever since.  \nMy \""""go to\"""" girl is Heidi.

I constantly receive compliments on my nails.  She always remembers my name whenever I come in, which really makes you feel welcome.  She goes the extra mile and really takes her time.  I don't mind spending an afternoon at the nail spa, because I make time for it.  I think if you are in a hurry, you should let your manicurist know so they can try and work in your time constraints.\nI also enjoy getting my eyelashes done there.  They do eyelash extensions for a very reasonable price.  They last 2-3 weeks and look very nice.  I usually get them done for special occasions.  If they start to come out before the 2 week period, they will fix them for you.  I would ask for Van or Mimi to do your eyelashes.  They both do a great job.\nAlso, a bit of advice for people that don't like to wait to get service... make an appointment.  Yes, this place is busy.  Evenings and weekends are the craziest.  They are very popular, evidence of how great they are.  I've gone on a Friday evening and it's packed.  Even with an appointment, I had to wait 20 minutes.

"Are you a BRIDE thinking about having your wedding here? STOP!\nCan you give a place no stars? This place has HORRIBLE reviews of JUST the HOTEL, despite their so called \""""Renovations\"""" , so beware! And I'm not even complaining about their Hotel! This review (Or RANT ha ha) is for the EVENTS/WEDDING  department. STAY AWAY! wasted 6 months of precious planning time working with Janeen and Tricia from the Plaza.  I was given tours of the property and what was \""""coming\"""" and promised how awesome the new banquet rooms would be. My first mistake.\nI was even promised 2009 event food and booze pricing for my wedding because of the inconvenience of their renovations. Because of that, I decided on the Plaza. A few months later, I was finally suckered into signing a contract and giving them a 500.00 deposit.. Then, I finally SAW the \""""new\"""" banquet rooms. My BAD.\nThey were normal, boring banquet rooms, and most of the area in them wasn't even NEW, including the carpet! If that wasn't enough of a joke, the two vendor companies the Plaza referred me to, to help decorate my event, were shockingly unprofessional. \nOne, called Ltevention, never returned calls or emails over a one month period, and the other, a lady named Maya, scoffed at me as a client because I had 'GASP' a budget! (In this economy, can you IMAGINE?)\n She expected me to want to shell out over 6000.00 just for floor to ceiling draping to make the room, as she put it, more \""""stylish\"""" ....in addition to all the linens, flowers, etc., that I wanted. (Never mind that I thought that since the room would have been a lot more elegant as promised over and OVER by the Plaza, why would draping even be necessary? It is, after all, an OPTION!)\n Then, to add insult to serious injury, when I told her I wasn't interested in those types of items, just simple flowers, linens and chair covers, her whole attitude and demeanor changed. She got snotty! After several attempts to contact her to finalize the rental of the simple items I did want, she chickened out of any contact with me, and enlisted the Plaza to tell me that she \""""would not work with me.\"""" And this was a vendor that my contracted Hotel, the PLAZA referred me to!! What?! So basically, I don't have enough money in my lowly budget to waste your time....Well, sorry. LOTS of people are on a wedding budget and don't have 30,000 to spend on a wedding. As a couple, we are paying for all of this ourselves.\n I was appalled that in this economy ANY vendor in any type of industry could SCOFF at taking on a client, no matter their budget. Unbelievable. \nWhen I expressed my frustration to the Plaza about these two quacks, (that THEY referred me to, mind you) they were of no help. All I got was the \""""too bad that's the way it is\"""" song and dance. (Just more professional sounding and wordy.)Then they repeatedly tried to professionally distance themselves from these \""""outside\"""" vendors by saying just that... \""""They don't officially work for us, blah blah\""""..but who cares? Don't they have any sense of professional integrity? That fact remains that the Plaza assured me that they would take stress and frustration out of the process for me by referring vendors. What about THAT promise?\nBy that point, they had my 500.00 for only 16 days and JUST the day before I had been emailed menus so I could actually, after MONTHS, finally start planning what my guests could eat. But by that time I had a BAD taste in my mouth, especially about the crappy banquet room, so I respectfully asked for my deposit back, in writing. (Yes, I did write \""""respectfully\"""" in my written request. I can show it to you.) Not that I stood a chance.\nBecause of course, no respect was given. Sure, officially I signed, and I knew they were gonna take my money and run, but I thought maybe, just MAYBE, because of the way their vendors handled me, and the fact that up to that point the only thing I had planned with them was seeing their craptacular ball room and I was pushed around and ignored, that I could appeal to any sort of professional ethics they might have and just respectfully bow out, hopefully with my deposit. I was so wrong. So I'm out $500.00, but I'd rather be out that than work with this dump. They have greedily keep the 500.00 which they did not in ANY way rightfully earn. \nThey lied about their commitment to work with me. The contract should have read..\""""We will help you only if you spend much more than what was discussed on your event. If not, you're on your own.\"""" And just so my fellow yelpers know, I am so not a \""""Bridezilla.\"""" All I want is a great party!

"Pacino's fell short on all requirements of a good restaurant. So it is Valentines Day night. I called in ahead of time and asked about the wait time, a discombobulated hostess shouted about in my ear trying to find out who could clean tables and how long and finally tells me they have one table open. We were there in a matter of only 5 minutes and saw plenty of open tables but shrugged it off. We waited while the table cleared and were sat down. After waiting nearly 25 minutes I finally caught the attention of a hostess and asked when we could expect to see our server and if we could see a menu. It is only now that I am told no menus are available that I can only opt in for their $40 per person 4 course pre fixe meal and neither one of us are 4 course hungry. I just asked that she have the server come over to the table to talk with us. *now quick side note I am an extremely observant person so when we were waiting for a table to clear earlier at the hostess desk I noticed the woman who should have been our waitress crying and being consoled by a girl near the front desk. Now I also have an empathetic heart and had felt sympathy for the woman when I saw this but if she had something going on that was interrupting her ability to work she should have gone and spoken with her manager for a solution*  Our waiter finally did come over and asked if we had questions about the pre fixe, I mentioned that we had never been told it was the only option and asked if we could order al a carte from the options available for the night. I was very kind yet firm in my request and before I even finished I got an onslaught of excuses, \""""the computers can't input that\"""" \""""we don't have the capability\"""" he even went as far as to begin to explain their food coding system and then finally did the right thing and said \""""let me check to see if that is possible\"""" his frustration showed through his voice and eyes but he came back and let me know they could and then inflated the al a carte prices pretty exorbitantly $25 for 5 shrimp raviolis $23 for their chicken with squash and scalloped potatoes on the side. His service got better as the night progressed and as he understood that my appreciation for him accommodating the request was not fake. My date said his food was good and mine was seeming the same until I bit into the middle of the ravioli and found that the center on each of them was still ice cold. I should have said something but I didn't, I was just tired from the day and the escapades already so I ate them avoiding the center on each. The food was good, minus the frozen centers, but I have to be honest in saying that Alessia's Ristorante Italiano down the way is of much better quality, taste and most importantly service. I also wanted to discuss the attitude of the owner, or at least I assume he was an owner or manager. He wore brightly colored red/orange pants with a striped orange shirt and graciously greeted every guest around us except our table. This was absolutely appalling! He even stopped by a table of what appeared to be regulars several times, laughing and personally removing their finished plates. I have a background with customer service and so I decided to give him a chance as not to misinterpret the body language of our table and looked him dead eye until he saw me and still I got nothing, not a polite head nod or a simple thank you. You really can not treat your guests like that, they have chosen to devote their time, money and valentines day to your restaurant and that is how you treat them?

"Sensational Food, Spellbinding View\n\nThe Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. \n\nOutside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. \n\nThe finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. \n\nDownsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. \n\nOverall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip.",Failed to initialize,1,,False,896

"I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.  \n\nI can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \""""all celery\"""" or vice versa. \n\nI prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect. \n\nI dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte.",Failed to initialize,1,,False,971

"I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour. \n\nThe first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.\n\nThe second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.\n\nBut since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.\nApparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.\nThis manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.\n\nThey have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.\n\n\nIf you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.\n\nMy major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!",Failed to initialize,0,,False,951
"The Griddle has a HUGE menu, so be prepared for that when you arrive.  My friends and I dined on a Sunday evening and had no problem walking up to get a table.  There's not a TON of variety anywhere on the menu except the pancakes.  The dining room is comfortable and really cuts off the casino floor noise, despite being directly next to it.  My friends and I ordered a mix of breakfast (omelette) and lunch/dinner (fish tacos and shrimp pesto sandwich) items and were definitely satisfied.  The only thing I would have enjoyed is more flavor in the omelette and accompanying breakfast potatoes.  Our server seemed a bit off her game, but we all have off days, so we wrote that off.  If you're looking for a unique dining experience in a Strip casino, check out The Griddle.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",Failed to initialize,1,,False,941

"This place has been on my radar for three months now. I finally made it for lunch a few days ago, and I have to say -it was a disappointing experience.\n\n  I chose menu item F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy Basil with chicken) -which was stir fried chicken, onions, chili, and Thai holy basil leaves. The chicken itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and dry. The dish appeared to be swimming in grease -instead of a sauce. I didn't know sliced chicken could be greasy... \n\nThe level 3 spice out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the food was bland. Why do most Thai places skimp on basil? I thought this was a dish that featured basil?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for basil underneath the rubbery overcooked chicken. \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean, quaint, and inviting. My order was done in 10 minutes which was nice considering I was on my lunch break. However, I would rather they took their time to make sure the dish actually tasted good. \n\nI won't come back as there are just too many good Thai places to choose from in Las Vegas.",Failed to initialize,0,,False,933
"This has to be the worst casino in Vegas. We wandered in here because it was somewhat close to our hotel and decided to play a few rounds of black jack. We quickly left. The clientele is awful- there were people hitting on 18s like they had never played black jack before. Additionally, the casino was extremely dirty. \n\nI will never be coming back here. There are too many well kept casinos in Vegas that I would rather hang out at.",Failed to initialize,0,,False,958
